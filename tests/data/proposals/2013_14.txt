Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the European Union Agency for Railways and repealing Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 /* COM/2013/027 final - 2013/0014 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

1.1.        Recent EU policydevelopments in the railway field

In its White Paper ‘Roadmap to a SingleEuropean Transport Area — Towards a competitive and resource efficienttransport system’, adopted on 28 March 2011 (‘the 2011 White Paper’), theCommission set out its vision of a Single European Railway Area, i.e. an internalrailway market in which European railway undertakings could provide serviceswithout unnecessary technical and administrative barriers.

The European Council conclusions of January2012 also highlight the importance of releasing the growth-creating potentialof a fully integrated Single Market, for network industries as well as others[1].Furthermore, the Commission Communication on Action for Stability, Growth andJobs adopted on 30 May 2012[2] stresses the importanceof reducing further the regulatory burden and barriers to entry in the railsector, making country-specific recommendations for this purpose. And on 6 June2012, the Commission adopted the Communication on strengthening the governanceof the single market, which likewise stresses the importance of the transportsector[3].

In the last decade, the EU railway markethas seen massive changes, gradually introduced by three legislative ‘railwaypackages’ (and some accompanying acts) intended to open up the national marketsand make railways more competitive and interoperable at EU level, whilemaintaining a high level of safety. However, despite the considerabledevelopment of EU laws and other measures (the ‘EU acquis’) establishingan internal market for rail transport services, the railways’ share of intra-EUtransport has remained modest. The Commission has therefore come forward with aFourth Railway Package to enhance the quality and efficiency of rail servicesby removing the remaining market obstacles.

The present Regulation is a component ofthe Fourth Railway Package focusing on the removal of remaining administrativeand technical barriers, in particular by establishing a common approach tosafety and interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railwayundertakings active across the EU, decreasing administrative costs andaccelerating administrative procedures, as well as avoiding disguiseddiscrimination, through a European Union Agency for Railways. It is intended toreplace the original founding Regulation, and add new important tasks to theAgency making it a truly European Railway Authority in the field ofinteroperability and safety.

1.2.        Why to replace existing Regulation881/2004 (as amended) with a new act?

Since 2004, when the original foundingRegulation was drafted, a number of developments have taken place in relationto the European railways and the Agency. There has been mounting evidence onthe functioning of the EU railway internal market, also in relation to itsinteroperability and safety aspects. New legislation emerged which resulted inamending the Agency Regulation (2008) or which developed the existing tasks ofERA without changing its Regulation (e.g. Decision 2011/155/EU).

The impact assessment report accompanyingthis proposal has identified a number of measures which would give new powersto the Agency and streamline existing processes.

Moreover, a number of changes have to beintroduced to improve the functioning of the Agency in result of the evaluationof ERA founding Regulation and of the Agency (2009-2010) as well as therecommendations of the Joint Statement of the Commission, the EuropeanParliament and the Council on decentralised agencies (2012), and the Position paperof the Administrative Board on the future of the Agency (2012). This concernsparticularly improvements to internal structure, governance and decision-makingof the Agency, and its relations with stakeholders.

A new Regulation will also help to clarify thestructure of the legal act (e.g. by removing and renumbering the Articles) andmake it more logical (e.g. by moving some Articles to more relevant Chapters,creating new Chapters and deleting the obsolete ones). Finally, theInteroperability and Safety Directives are also being amended within thislegislative package and they are closely related to the tasks of ERA, thereforethis Regulation has to properly take this into account.

On the basis above, and taking into accountthe advice of the Legal Service, the Commission intends to propose a new ERA Regulationreplacing original Regulation 881/2004. There is a number of changes inrelation to Regulation 881/2004, which can be grouped in three differentcategories:

·                        New provisions: newtasks of the Agency (issuing vehicle authorisations for placing on the market, authorisationsfor placing in service of trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems andsafety certificates), reinforced control over national authorities, more powersin relation to national rules, new source of ERA’s budget (fees and charges),the Board of Appeal; some new provisions – especially in the internalorganisation part – result from the Common Approach on the EU agencies.

·                        Clarification/simplification of existingprovisions: especially in relation to workingmethods, the ERTMS, railway staff, registers, other tasks.

·                        Updates due tothe evolution of the legislative and political framework: provisions concerninginternal structure and operation, as well as references to comitologyprocedures and delegated acts.

·                        Editorial changesin relation to the original Regulation.

1.3.        Links between thisRegulation and the Interoperability and Safety Directives

Directive 2008/57/EC (RailwayInteroperability Directive) and Directive 2004/49/EC (Railway Safety Directive)are closely linked with original Regulation 881/2004. In the 4thrailway package, these Directives are proposed to be recast; they will,nevertheless, remain closely linked with the present Regulation. Thispredominantly stems from the fact that the Agency acts in the fields of railwayinteroperability and safety for which those directives provide the legal basis.

In the present Regulation, the links concernin particular:

–                        technical specifications for interoperability(TSIs; Interoperability Directive), common safety targets (CSTs; SafetyDirective) and common safety methods (CSMs; Safety Directive): the Agency isresponsible for drawing up recommendations for them to be adopted by theCommission, and for issuing opinions to the Commission regardingnon-application of TSIs;

–                        safety certificates: the Agency is responsiblefor issuing them, while the full procedure is provided in the Safety Directive;

–                        registers: the Agency is responsible for issuingrecommendations to the Commission regarding specification for registers(referred to in the Interoperability Directive) and their revision, andensuring there are accessible to the public;

–                        authorisations for placing on the market forrailway vehicles and types of vehicles and authorisation for placing in serviceof trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems: the Agency isresponsible for issuing them, while the full procedure for applying for them isprovided in the Interoperability Directive;

–                        telematics applications and European RailTraffic Management System (ERTMS): these are specific areas governed byrelevant TSIs adopted under the Interoperability Directive where the Agency hasan important role to play being a system authority;

–                        notified conformity assessment bodies: theAgency is responsible for supporting and monitoring their activities while theyare created and given tasks by the Interoperability Directive;

–                        national safety authorities: the Agency isresponsible for supporting and monitoring their activities while they arecreated and given tasks by the Safety Directive;

–                        national railway rules: the Agency isresponsible for their examination with a view to their reduction while theprocedure for their notification is provided for in the Safety and InteroperabilityDirectives.

2.           RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THEINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

The Commission services have discussed thedevelopments of the Single European Railway Area with sector representatives onan on-going basis. In 2010-2011 it conducted an ex post evaluation ofRegulation 881/2004 and the functioning of the European Union Agency forRailways[4]. This evaluation, togetherwith the general evaluation of the EU Agencies in 2009, showed the added valueprovided by the Agency and in general a positive opinion of stakeholders inrelation to ERA and its outputs. The results of the evaluation have been usedas an important input and preparatory work to the subsequent process of impactassessment linked with the revision of the Regulation.

The European Commission carried out athorough impact assessment to support legislative proposals on improving the efficiencyand competitiveness of the Single European Railway Area in the field ofinteroperability and safety. An Impact Assessment Steering Group (IASG) wascreated in June 2011 to which all DGs were invited by DG MOVE to participate.

An external consultant drafted an impactassessment support study and conducted a targeted consultation of stakeholders.The targeted consultation started on 18 November 2011 with an internet surveythat finished on 30 December 2011. It was followed by interviews with the mostsignificant stakeholders and a stakeholder workshop at the end of February2012.

Since then, DG MOVE has engaged inbilateral meetings with the sector to gauge their views on what should be donein the Fourth Package in the area of interoperability and safety.

Given the technical nature of theinitiative, no public consultation was carried out. However, the Commission tookcare that all interested parties were consulted in due time and discussionscovered all the key elements of the initiative.

Impact Assessment Board:

On 5 September 2012 the Impact AssessmentBoard met and subsequently gave a positive opinion. The Board’s main recommendationswere incorporated in the impact assessment report:

–                        more statistics and information on stakeholders’consultation were added;

–                        expected synergies with other elements of the FourthRailway Package were added and indirect impacts clarified;

–                        the core measures common to options 2-5 weredescribed in more detail and clarified regarding their differentiation;

–                        the methods used to assess impact were clarifiedand better explained; the logic was brought out by better cross-referencing;

–                        administrative costs for economic actors(railway operators) and the cost to public administrations (nationalauthorities, ERA and the Commission) were distinguished more clearly.

Options identified:

Based on the screening of individualmeasures, the Commission has identified five policy options (options 2-6),besides the baseline scenario. By construction, options 2-5 concern primarilythe level of interaction between the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA orthe Agency) and national authorities and are all capable of tackling the threeoperational objectives. Option 6 is a set of horizontal measures which aremostly independent of the interactions between ERA and national authorities andcan be applied on top of any of the option 2-5, with expected reinforcement ofthe overall final impact.

Option 1: Baseline scenario (do nothing) —continuing on the path that is currently set out for the sector

Option 2: Greater coordination role for theAgency in ensuring a consistent approach to certification of railwayundertakings and vehicle authorisation

Option 3: ERA as a one-stop-shop, where thefinal decision on certification and authorisation remains with the NSAs but ERAperforms entry and exit checks of applications and of the decisions

Option 4: ERA and NSAs share competencies,where the final decision on certification and authorisation is taken by theAgency

Option 5: ERA takes over activities of NSAsin relation to certification of railway undertakings and vehicle authorisation

Option 6: Horizontal measures, includesother legislative and soft measures (beyond sharing the responsibilitiesbetween national authorities and ERA) that could be implemented to improve thecompetitiveness of the rail sector, like    enhancing the role of ERA in thedissemination of railway-related information and training or migrating fromnational technical and safety rules to a system of EU rules (through theidentification of unnecessary rules by ERA and NSAs and then the requirementfor national authorities to remove those rules, as well as limiting thepossibility of adopting new rules).

Impacts of the options: The environmentalimpact of all the options was assessed as positive, though low. The socialimpact of all the options was assessed as low/marginal.

The table below presents the economic benefits(efficiency) and number of objectives met (effectiveness) for combined options:

Option || Efficiency (Total Net Benefit € m) || Effectiveness (number of operational objectives met)

Option 2+6: Further ERA ‘Coordination’ + horizontal measures || 411 || 1

Option 3+6: ERA as One-Stop-Shop+ horizontal measures || 461 || 2

Option 4+6: ERA and NSAs share competencies + horizontal measures || 497 || 3

Option 5+6: ERA takes over activities of NSAs regarding authorisation & certification+ horizontal measures || 476 || 3

It was concluded that Option 4 (combinedwith option 6) was the preferred option as it provides the best balance ofoutcomes in relation to:

–                        the industry, in terms of reduced costs andtimescales for safety certification and vehicle and other sub-systemauthorisation;

–                        cost implications for the EU budget;

–                        the cost impacts on national institutions;

–                        accordance with the subsidiarity andproportionality principles;

–                        addressing the problems identified, and

–                        meeting the objectives.

More information on the impact assessmentand the results of the stakeholder consultation is provided in the Commissionstaff working document accompanying legislative proposals to eliminateremaining administrative and technical barriers in the field ofinteroperability and safety on the EU railway market. It will be published onthe website of the Secretariat-General of the Commission following the adoptionof this legal act.

3.           LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL

This section comments on and explains the mainprovisions of the new ERA Regulation, when necessary in relation to amendmentsto the original text of Regulation 881/2004.

CHAPTER 1 PRINCIPLES:

Article 1: the objectives have been revisedto reflect new tasks of the Agency and moved to the recitals; instead, a"subject matter and scope" is given, for clarity.

Article 2: legal status moved here as moreappropriate (previously original Article 22).

Article 3: amended to properly reflect newtypes of acts of the Agency.

CHAPTER 2WORKING METHODS:

New chapter added to cover issues whichwere originally in other chapters but which in fact relate to the methods by whichERA attains its objectives.

Article 4: "working parties"article rewritten for legal clarity, in particular: the reference to AEIF is obsoletenow and can be deleted; original Article 24(4) was moved here instead of thearticle on ERA staff; rules of procedure to be adopted by the Board.

Article 7: "impact assessment"; theoriginal text limited cost-benefit analysis to safety only (Article 6(4)); thistask should not be part of any particular Agency activity, hence the need tomove the paragraphs into a general section, make it generally applicable andprovide clear tasks; this is in accordance with the Position paper of the Boardon the future of ERA and the principles of activity-based budgeting and management.

Article 8: "studies"; previouslyArticle 20 — moved as studies are means of achieving the objectives and nottasks as such.

Article 9: "opinions"; formerlyArticle 10 on Technical Opinions; the word ‘technical’ is deleted, in line withthe directives; paragraph 2a(b) removed as obsolete; paragraph 3 (original paragraph2b) amended to broaden its scope (previously limited to TSIs only, without aclear rationale).

Article 10: "visits to MemberStates"; previously Article 33 — moved to this section as the visits aremeans of achieving the Agency’s objectives.

CHAPTER 3 TASKSRELATING TO RAILWAY SAFETY:

Article 11: "technical support –safety"; minor changes clarifying the Agency’s tasks.

Article 12: "safetycertificates"; new role of ERA (issuing of safety certificates), asproposed in the IA report, in line with the revised Safety Directive.

Article 13: "maintenance of vehicles";new article — left over from original Chapter 3a, simplified and moved to thesafety part as being the most relevant.

Article 14: "transport of dangerousgoods by rail"; new article, formalising what ERA is actually doingalready in the field of transport of dangerous goods by rail.

CHAPTER 4 TASKSRELATING TO INTEROPERABILITY:

Article 15: "technical support – interoperability";amended slightly to reflect changes in the Interoperability Directive (points band c) and to clarify the existing tasks of ERA.

Article 16: "vehicle authorisations";new article — covering ERA’s new role in issuing vehicle authorisations forplacing on the market, as proposed in the IA report, in line with the amendedInteroperability Directive.

Article 17: "authorisations for typeof vehicles"; new article — covering ERA’s new role in issuing authorisationsfor placing on the market for types of vehicles, in line with the amendedInteroperability Directive.

Article 18: "authorisation for placingin service of trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems"; newarticle — covering ERA’s new role regarding authorisation of track-side control-commandand signalling equipment; linked with ERA’s role as the system authority andthe consequences of the new task of issuing of vehicle authorisations forplacing on the market for the ERTMS (in order to ensure that the authorisationsfor placing on the market issued for vehicles with ERTMS equipment on board areconsistent with track-side systems).

Article 19: "telematicsapplications"; new article added to formalise the existing role ERA playsalready, according to TAP/TAF TSI, and in line with the IA report.

Article 20: "support for the notifiedconformity assessment bodies"; amended — provisions on Commissionmonitoring of notified bodies have been moved to the new section on monitoring;the remainder is support for notified bodies (the Commission assigned tasksrelating to the Technical Secretariat of the NB Rail to the Agency as of 20April 2011 and this activity is already on-going; this needs to be properlyreflected in the legislation).

CHAPTER 5 TASKSRELATING TO NATIONAL RULES (moved after the chapter on interoperability):

Articles 21, 22 and 23: "nationalrules"; new articles which incorporate original Articles 9a and 9b, amendedto align procedures with the Interoperability and Safety Directives and takeinto account the extended powers of ERA in relation to national rules resultingfrom the IA report and draft report of the Task Force on National Safety Rules;management of the IT database given clearly to ERA, in order to clarifyprevious mixed responsibilities (Commission and ERA) and to overcome currenttechnical, coordination and ownership problems.

CHAPTER 6 TASKSRELATING TO ERTMS: the ERTMS section deserves a separate new chapter.

Articles 24-28: "ERTMS tasks" theseincorporate the original Article 21a, amended to clarify the responsibilitiesof the Agency and other actors in relation to the ERTMS, to improve ERTMS deployment,and to reflect what ERA is already currently doing in this field; Article 13e amendedin line with preliminary Commission evaluation of four years of technicalfollow-up.

CHAPTER 7 TASKSRELATING TO MONITORING SINGLE EUROPEAN RAILWAY AREA: new chapter — varioustasks related to monitoring are now combined together in one chapter for bettervisibility and clarity.

Article 29: "monitoring of nationalsafety authorities"; new article — new ERA task: control over NSAs, asproposed in the IA report (and in the evaluation of the ERA Regulation).

Article 30: "monitoring of notifiedbodies"; new article — new ERA task: control over notified bodies, asproposed in the IA report.

Article 31: "monitoring progress ofinteroperability and safety"; partly based on original Article 9 (newparagraphs 1 and 2, with ERA’s tasks in relation to safety monitoring nowclarified), on original Article 14 (new paragraphs 3 and 4, with two separatereports on interoperability and safety now merged into one); paragraph 5 — basedon Article 21b (2a), in accordance with the IA report and the evaluation of theERA Regulation.

CHAPTER 8 OTHERTASKS – new chapter combining previous chapters on registers, railway staff andother tasks:

Article 32: "railway staff";combines original Articles 16b, 16c and 17 to simplify: some tasks areobsolete, others are described in Directive 2007/59; amended to avoid legalambiguity and repetition.

Article 33: "registers"; thisarticle combines original Articles 18 and 19, updated and aligned withlegislation.

Article 34: "networks of nationalsafety authorities, investigating bodies and representative bodies"; previouslypartly in original Article 6(5) and Article 9; the network of representativebodies has been added (paragraph 2) to improve and structure coordination ofstakeholders at Agency level; paragraph 3 has been added to improve andstructure consultation of all stakeholders, and ultimately to obtain higherquality outputs from the Agency (in line with the evaluation of ERA Regulationand Position paper on the future of ERA).

Article 35: "communication anddissemination"; new article, formalising partly the existing activities ofERA and stemming from IA report, the evaluation of the ERA Regulation and thePosition paper on the future of the Agency.

Article 36: "research and promotion ofinnovation"; original article with research added, formalising what ERA isalready doing to a large extent; in line with the Position paper of the Boardon the Future of ERA.

Article 37: "assistance to theCommission"; amended slightly.

Article 38: "assistance with theassessment of rail projects"; originally Article 15, scope was extended tocover safety.

Article 39: "assistance to MS andstakeholders"; new article, following the IA report (measure from Option6) and the results of the evaluation of the ERA Regulation.

Article 40: "international relations";new article formalising what ERA is already doing to a large extent; in linewith the IA report and the Position paper of the Board on the Future of ERA.

Article 41: "spare parts"; newarticle — new task in line with the IA report.

CHAPTER 9 ORGANISATIONOF THE AGENCY: drafted largely to follow the Joint Statement of the Commission,the European Parliament and the Council on decentralised agencies and theCommon Approach (2012), in particular in relation to: extended competences ofthe Management Board (previously Administrative); creation of Executive Board;multi-annual work programme; other standard provisions regarding HR andbudgetary issues.

Other important changes:

Article 48: "annual and multi-annualwork programmes"; new, separate article on work programmes deemed usefulfor clarity; in accordance with the Joint Statement and recommendations of the CoA,EP, the evaluation of the ERA Regulation and the Position paper of the ERABoard on the Future of the Agency (multi-annual perspective, ABB and ABM,relations with stakeholders).

Articles 51-57: "Board ofAppeal"; new articles — Board of Appeal necessary following extension ofERA competences (issuing of vehicle authorisations for placing on the marketand safety certificates); IA report provides for the creation of an independentAppeal Body outside the Agency, however, it seems that the solution already inplace at the EASA is more appropriate; based on the relevant provisions of theEASA Regulation.

CHAPTER 10FINANCIAL PROVISIONS:

Article 58(2): new point (c) — new sourcesof ERA income added (external fees and charges for issuing vehicle authorisationsfor placing on the market and safety certificates (new tasks)); new point (e) —to bring it into line with the EASA regulation

CHAPTER 11 STAFF:new chapter, following largely standard provisions resulting from the CommonApproach on agencies (Articles 62 and 63).

Article 61: "staff – generalprovisions"; originally Article 24, amended in accordance with the JointStatement on agencies, the evaluation of the ERA Regulation and the Position paperof the ERA Board on the Future of the Agency; previous limitations of maximumcontract deleted.

CHAPTER 12 GENERALPROVISIONS:

Articles 64, 66-68, 70-72: moved from otherparts of the original Regulation, amended if necessary following JointStatement on agencies.

Article 65: "headquarters agreementand operating conditions"; new article, following the Joint Statement ondecentralised agencies (2012).

Article 69: "cooperation with nationalauthorities and bodies"; new articles resulting from new powers of ERA toissue certificates and authorisations; cooperation with national bodies andauthorities in some cases deemed necessary due to their expertise; possibilityof (sub)contract part of ERA's tasks.

CHAPTER 13 FINALPROVISIONS: new chapter

Article 73 and 74: "delegatedacts"; new articles — following ERA’s new powers (to issue safetycertificates and vehicle authorisations for placing on the market, ownresources) there is a need to adopt delegated measures; this is similar to thecase of EASA.

Article 75: "committee procedure";new article, made in order not to refer to other acts (InteroperabilityDirective).

Article 76: "evaluation andreview"; original article amended in accordance with the Joint Statementon agencies.

ARTICLES WHICH STAYED THE SAME AS INREGULATION 881/2004: 5, 6, 58, 59, 60.

4.           BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

This new Regulation provides a legislativebasis for budgetary and staff commitments in relation to the European UnionAgency for Railways. The detailed calculations are provided in the Annex, inthe Legislative Financial Statement.

It is important to point out that, as faras ERA staffing is concerned, the present act incorporates:

1.           resources calculationsfrom two previous Financial Legislative Statements attached to the originalRegulation 881/2004 and the 2008 amendment to it (Regulation 1335/2008), whichprovided for 104 temporary staff for ERA;

2.           budgetary procedures for 2005-2013by which the Budgetary Authority granted ERA an extra 39 posts to coveradditional tasks not reflected in the founding Regulation, resulting in total143 temporary staff posts in 2013;

3.           the estimated resourcesimplications of the new tasks and enhanced powers of ERA envisaged in thecurrent new Regulation, set at 43 persons.

Regarding point 2, note that thenumber of posts has gradually increased since ERA was set up in 2005. Thischange has been subject to detailed annual scrutiny and has been adopted by thebudgetary authority every year in accordance with the number of posts proposedby the Commission. The main explanation for the difference between point 1 and2 is that a number of functions and activities such as legal affairs, DataProtection Officer, Secretariat for the Administrative Board, internal audit,quality and business planning, economic evaluation (impact assessment),procurement, facilities management, and a Head of Administration were not providedfor in the founding Regulation — or at least not planned to be carried out bydedicated staff. For some areas of activity, including HR, IT and Finance,resource needs were considerably underestimated.

Concerning economic evaluation, thisactivity follows from the fact that ERA was set up to contribute to anintegrated and competitive railway area. It has been an integral part of theAgency’s activities from the beginning — even if no dedicated staff wereprovided for in the financial statement. The need for this activity isunquestionable and has recently grown in line with the Activity-Based Budgetingapproach; this is reflected in the fact that a new Article is proposed forinclusion in the new Agency Regulation.

In addition to these developments, variousCommission acts have given the Agency additional tasks with resourceimplications, without being properly reflected in the financial statement. Forexample, Commission Decision 2011/155/EU on the publication and management ofthe reference document referred to in Article 27(4) of Directive 2008/57/EC putadditional tasks on the Agency in relation to making transparent andsimplifying the processes and rules used for authorising railway vehicles andsubsystems. More specifically, ERA’s role concerns documentation ofauthorisation processes in Member States, documentation of national rulesapplied to the authorisation of railway vehicles and checking of dataconsistencies, support to National Safety Authorities and management andmaintenance of data.

Regarding point 3, the budgetary andstaff implications of new and extended tasks stem principally from the impactassessment calculations, implementation of the recommendations in the JointStatement by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council ondecentralised agencies, Court of Auditors and Internal Audit Servicerecommendations, and the evaluation of the ERA Regulation. All the changes inlegislation are substantially explained in part 3 of this Memorandum. The totalof 70 persons is estimated to be needed to deal with these new and extendedtasks, with 43 additional staff in relation to the current level of staffing ofthe Agency. These 43 new persons will be dealing with issuing authorisationsand certificates and will be covered by external fees and charges while the remainingneeds of 27 persons will be covered by internal redeployment of existing staffof the Agency. Therefore, there will be no additional impact on the EU budget(except for years 2015 and 2016, when external fees and charges will not beavailable yet).

The planned additional personnel of 43 wouldcover the following categories:

·                        Technical experts (41 persons), to deal withissuing of authorisations for placing on the market of vehicles and vehiclestypes (30), authorisations for placing in service of trackside control-commandand signalling sub-systems (6) and safety certificates (5);

·                        Linked administrative staff (2), including an accountantto deal with management of a planned system of external fees and charges,including cooperation with national authorities.

The external fees and charges would alsocover linked overhead costs, mainly:

·                        Translation of decisions issued by ERA intonational languages;

·                        IT system needed for accountancy purposes(external fees and charges).

The remaining 27 persons, to be covered byinternal redeployment of existing staff of the Agency, would deal with:

·                        Monitoring of national safety authorities andnotified bodies, and implementationof national safety and interoperability legislation ;

·                        Reduction of number of national rules ;

·                        Advice and support to Member States andstakeholders, dissemination of railway-related information and training andcoordination of potential spare parts to be standardised .

The overall budgetary implication of ERA forthe EU budget in 2015-2020 is estimated at € 157.113 M. The cost to the EUbudget of new tasks amounts to € 0.4113 M as from 2017 onwards they will becovered by fees and charges paid by the industry.

There is also impact on Commission resources (inthe DG MOVE). With regard to this, the present Regulation incorporates:

1.           resources calculationsfrom two previous Legislative Financial Statements attached to the originalRegulation 881/2004 and the 2008 amendment to it (Regulation 1335/2008), whichprovided for two officials/temporary staff for the Commission;

2.           changes for 2005-2013, withthree extra Commission staff dealing with ERA-related issues, to coveradditional tasks not reflected in the founding Regulation;

The overall total for the Commission linkedto the current initiative will be 5 persons, with no new staff requested.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

on the European Union Agency for Railways

and repealing Regulation (EC) No881/2004

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1)thereof,

Having regard to the proposal fromthe European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],

Having regard to the opinion of theCommittee of the Regions[6],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)       The progressiveestablishment of a European railway area without frontiers requires Unionaction in the field of the technical regulations applicable to railways withregard to the technical aspects (interoperability) and the safety aspects, thetwo being inextricably linked and both requiring higher level of harmonisationat the Union level. Relevant railway legislation, in particular three railwaypackages, was adopted in the last two decades, with Directive 2004/49/EC of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on safety on theCommunity’s railways and Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and ofthe Council of 17 June 2008 on the interoperability of the rail system withinthe Community being the most relevant.

(2)       Simultaneous pursuit ofthe goals of railway safety and interoperability requires substantial technicalwork which must be led by a specialised body. That is why it was necessary, aspart of the Second Railway Package in 2004, to create within the existinginstitutional framework, and with respect for the balance of power in the Union,a European agency responsible for railway safety and interoperability(hereinafter referred to as the Agency).

(3)       The European RailwayAgency was originally established by Regulation (EC) 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of29 April 2004[7], in order to promote the establishment of a European railway area withoutborders and to help revitalise the railway sector while reinforcing itsessential advantages in terms of safety. Regulation 881/2004 has to be replaced by a new act due tosubstantial amount of changes to the tasks of the Agency and its internalorganisation.

(4)       TheFourth Railway Package proposes important changes to improve the functioning ofthe Single European railway area through amendments by way of recast to Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive2008/57/EC, both directly linked to the tasks of the Agency. Those Directives,together with this Regulation, provide in particular for performing tasksrelated to issuing vehicle authorisations and safety certificates at the Unionlevel. It implies a greater role of the Agency.

(5)       The Agency shouldcontribute to the creation and effective functioning of a Single Europeanrailway area without frontiers and guaranteeing a high level of safety whileimproving the competitive position of the railway sector. That should beattained by contributing, on technical matters, to the implementation ofEuropean Union legislation by enhancing the level of interoperability of railwaysystems and to developing a common approach to safety on the European railwaysystem. The Agency should also perform the role of European authorityresponsible for issuing authorisations for placing on the market for railwayvehicles and for types of vehicles, safety certificates for railwayundertakings and authorisations for placing in service of tracksidecontrol-command and signalling sub-systems. Moreover, it should monitor nationalrailway rules and the performance of national authorities acting in the railwayinteroperability and safety fields.

(6)       In pursuing itsobjectives, the Agency should take full account of the process of enlargementof the Union and of the specific constraints relating to rail links with thirdcountries. The Agency should have sole responsibility for the functions andpowers assigned to it.

(7)       The Agency, whileperforming its tasks, and particularly in relation to drafting recommendations,should take upmost account of external railway expertise. This expertise shouldpredominantly consist of professionals from the railway sector and the relevantnational authorities. They should form competent and representative workingparties of the Agency.

(8)       In order to provideinsight into the economic effects on the railway sector and its impact onsociety, to allow others to make informed decisions, and to manage the workpriorities and resource allocation more effectively within the Agency, theAgency should further develop its engagement in the impact assessment activity.

(9)       The Agency should provideindependent and objective technical support, predominantly to the Commission. Directive…. [Railway Interoperability] provides the basis for drafting and revising TechnicalSpecifications for Interoperability (TSIs) while Directive … [Railway Safety] providesthe basis for drafting and revising Common Safety Methods (CSMs) and CommonSafety Targets (CSTs). The continuity of the work and the development of theTSIs, CSMs and CSTs over time require a permanent technical framework and a dedicatedstaff of a specialised body. To this end, the Agency should be responsible forproviding the Commission with recommendations in relation to drafting andrevising the TSIs, CSMs and CSTs. The national safety organisations andregulatory bodies should be equally able to request an independent technicalopinion from the Agency.

(10)     Railway undertakings havebeen faced with various problems when applying for safety certificates tocompetent national authorities, ranging from protracting procedures andexcessive costs to unfair treatment, especially of new entrants. Thecertificates issued in one Member State have not been unconditionallyrecognised in other Member States, with a detriment to the Single European railarea. In order to make the procedures for issuing safety certificates torailway undertakings more efficient and impartial, it is essential to migratetowards a single safety certificate valid throughout the Union and issued bythe Agency. The revised Directive … [Railway Safety Directive] provides a basisfor this.

(11)     Currently Directive 2008/57/ECprovides, in the case of rail vehicles, an authorisation of placing in servicein each Member State, except in specific cases. The Task Force on vehicleauthorisation set up by the Commission in 2011 discussed several cases wheremanufacturers and railway undertakings have suffered from excessive durationand cost of the authorisation process and proposed a number of improvements. Assome problems are due to the complexity of the current vehicle authorisation process,it should be simplified. Each rail vehicle should only receive oneauthorisation and this authorisation for placing on the market for vehicles andfor types of vehicles should be issued by the Agency. This would bring tangiblebenefits for the sector by reducing the costs and time of the procedure, andwould diminish the risk of potential discrimination, especially of newcompanies wishing to enter a railway market. The revised Directive … [Railway Interoperability]provides a basis for this.

(12)     In order to further pursuethe development of Single European rail area, in particular with relation toproviding appropriate information to freight customers and passengers, andtaking into account current involvement of the Agency, it is necessary to giveit a strengthened role in the field of telematics applications. This wouldensure their consistent development and swift deployment.

(13)     Given the importance of theEuropean Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) for the smooth development ofthe Single European railway area and its safety, and taking into account itsfragmented development to date, it is necessary to strengthen its s overallcoordination at the Union level. Therefore the Agency, as the most competentUnion body, should be given a more prominent role in this field to ensureconsistent development of the ERTMS, to contribute to ensuring that ERTMSequipment complies with the specifications in force and to ensure thatERTMS-related European research programmes are coordinated with the developmentof ERTMS technical specifications. Moreover, in order to make the proceduresfor issuing authorisations for placing in service of trackside control-commandand signalling sub-systems more efficient and impartial, it is essential to migratetowards a single authorisation valid in the Union and issued by the Agency. Therevised Directive … [Railway Interoperability Directive] provides a basis forthis.

(14)     Competent nationalauthorities have been normally charging for issuing vehicle authorisations and safetycertificates. With the transfer competence to the Union level, the Agencyshould be entitled to charge the applicants for issuing the certificates andauthorisations mentioned in the preceding recitals. The level of those chargesshould be equal to or lower than the current average in the Union and should bedetermined in a delegated act to be adopted by the Commission.

(15)     It is a general objectivethat the transfer of functions and tasks from the Member States to the Agencyshould be done efficiently, without any reduction in the current high levels ofsafety. The Agency should have sufficient resources for its new tasks, and thetiming of the allocation of these resources should be based on clearly definedneeds. Taking into account the know-how of national authorities, in particularthe National Safety Authorities, the Agency should be allowed to makeappropriate use of that expertise when granting the relevant authorisations andcertificates. To this end, secondment of national experts to the Agency shouldbe encouraged.

(16)     Directive … [RailwaySafety] and Directive … [Railway Interoperability] provide for examinationof national measures from the point of view of safety and interoperability, andcompatibility with competition rules. They also limit the possibility forMember States to adopt new national rules. The current system in which a largenumber of national rules continue to exist leads to possible conflicts with Unionrules and creates a risk of insufficient transparency and disguiseddiscrimination of foreign operators, especially the smaller and new ones. Inorder to migrate towards a system of truly, transparent and impartial railway rulesat Union level, gradual reduction of national rules needs to be reinforced. Anopinion based on independent and neutral expertise is essential at Union level.To this end, the role of the Agency needs to be strengthened.

(17)     Performance, organisationand decision-making procedures in the field of railway interoperability andsafety vary substantially among the national safety authorities and notified conformityassessment bodies, with a detrimental effect to smooth operation of the SingleEuropean rail area. In particular, small and medium companies wishing to enterthe railway market in another Member State can be negatively affected.Therefore, a strengthened coordination with a view to greater harmonisation atthe Union level is essential. To this end, the Agency should monitor thenational safety authorities and notified conformity assessment bodies throughaudits and inspections.

(18)     In the field of safety, itis important to ensure the greatest possible transparency and an effective flowof information. An analysis of performance, based on common indicators andlinking all parties in the sector, is important and should be carried out. Asregards statistics, close collaboration with Eurostat is necessary.

(19)     In order to monitorprogress with the railway interoperability and safety, the Agency should beresponsible for publishing a relevant report every two years. Given itstechnical expertise and impartiality, the Agency should also assist theCommission with monitoring the implementation of Union railway safety andinteroperability legislation.

(20)     The interoperability of theTrans-European network should be enhanced and the new investment projectschosen for support by the Union should be in line with the objective ofinteroperability set in Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliamentand of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for thedevelopment of the Trans-European transport network[8].The Agency is the right institution to contribute to these objectives.

(21)     Rolling stock maintenanceis an important part of the safety system. There has been no genuine Europeanmarket for the maintenance of rail equipment owing to the lack of a system forcertification of maintenance workshops. This situation has been adding to thecosts for the sector and results in journeys without loads. A Europeancertification system for maintenance workshops should therefore gradually bedeveloped and updated, with the Agency being the most appropriate body topropose adequate solutions to the Commission.

(22)     The vocational qualificationsrequired for train drivers are a major factor in both safety andinteroperability in the Union. They are also a precondition for the freemovement of workers in the railway industry. This question should be tackledwith respect to the existing framework for social dialogue. The Agency should providethe technical support necessary in order to take account of this aspect at Unionlevel.

(23)     The Agency should organiseand facilitate cooperation between the national safety authorities, the nationalinvestigating bodies and representative bodies from the railway sector actingon at European level, in order to promote good practices, exchange of relevantinformation, collection of railway-related data and monitor the overall safetyperformance of the railway system.

(24)     In order to ensure the greatestpossible transparency and equal access for all parties to relevant information,the documents envisaged for the railway interoperability and safety processesshould be accessible to the public. The same applies to licences, safetycertificates and other relevant railway documents. The Agency should provide anefficient means of exchanging and publishing this information.

(25)     Promotion of innovation andresearch in the railway field is an important task which the Agency shouldencourage, given its reputation and position. Any financial assistance providedwithin the framework of the Agency’s activities in this respect should not leadto any distortion in the relevant market.

(26)     In order to increase theefficiency of the Union financial support, its quality and compatibility withrelevant technical regulations, the Agency, as the only Union body withreputable competence in the railway field, should play an active role in the assessmentof rail projects.

(27)     Railway interoperabilityand safety legislation, implementation guides or recommendations of the Agencymay sometimes pose interpretation and other problems to the stakeholders.Proper and uniform understanding of those acts is a precondition for effectiveimplementation of the railway acquis and the functioning of the railway market.Therefore, the Agency should actively engage in training and explanatoryactivities in that regard.

(28)     In order to perform itstasks properly, the Agency should have legal personality and an autonomousbudget funded mainly through a contribution by the Union and through fees andcharges paid by applicants. In order to ensure independence in its dailymanagement and in the opinions, recommendations and decisions which it issues,the Agency’s organisation should be transparent, the Executive Director shouldhave full responsibility. The Agency’s staff should be independent and should representan appropriate balance of short-term and long-term contracts, in order tomaintain its organisational knowledge and business continuity while keepingnecessary and on-going exchange of expertise with the railway sector.

(29)     In order to ensureeffectively the accomplishment of the functions of the Agency, the MemberStates and the Commission should be represented on a Management Board vestedwith the necessary powers, including to establish the budget and approve the annualand multi-annual work programmes.

(30)     In order to guarantee thetransparency of the Management Board’s decisions, representatives of thesectors concerned should attend its meetings, but without the right to vote,that right being reserved for the representatives of public authorities who areaccountable to the democratic control authorities. The representatives of thesector should be appointed by the Commission on the basis of theirrepresentativeness at Union level of railway undertakings, infrastructuremanagers, railway industry, workers unions, passengers and freight customers.

(31)     In order to properlyprepare the meetings of the Management Board and to advice it in relation tothe decisions to be taken, an advisory Executive Board should be created.

(32)     It is necessary to ensurethat parties affected by decisions made by the Agency enjoy the necessaryremedies in an independent and impartial manner. An appropriate appealmechanism should be set up so that decisions of the Executive Director can besubject to appeal to a specialised Board of Appeal, whose decisions are, inturn, open to action before the Court of Justice.

(33)     A broader strategicperspective in relation to the activities of the Agency would help to plan andmanage its resources more effectively and would contribute to higher quality ofits outputs. Therefore, a multi-annual work programme should be adopted andupdated regularly by the Management Board, after proper consultation of therelevant stakeholders.

(34)     The Agency’s work should betransparent. Effective control by the European Parliament should be ensuredand, to this end, the European Parliament should have the possibility ofhearing the Executive Director of the Agency and being consulted on themulti-annual work programme. The Agency should also apply the relevant Union legislationconcerning public access to documents.

(35)     Over the past years, asmore decentralised agencies have been created, the budgetary authority haslooked to improve transparency and control over the management of the Union fundingallocated to them, in particular concerning the budgetisation of fees,financial control, power of discharge, pension scheme contributions and theinternal budgetary procedure (code of conduct). In a similar way, Regulation(EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office(OLAF)[9] should apply withoutrestriction to the Agency, which should accede to the Inter-institutionalAgreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council ofthe European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerninginternal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office[10].

(36)     Since the objectives of theaction proposed, namely to establish a specialised body to formulate commonsolutions on matters concerning railway safety and interoperability, cannot besufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the joint nature of thework to be done, and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Unionmay adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set outin Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle ofproportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyondwhat is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

(37)     In order to properlydetermine the level of fees and charges which the Agency is entitled to levy, thepower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission inrespect of articles dealing with issuing and renewal of authorisations forplacing in service of trackside control-command and signalling subsystems,authorisations for placing on the market for vehicles and for types of vehicles,and safety certificates. It is of particular importance that the Commissioncarry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including atexpert level.         The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure asimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to theEuropean Parliament and Council.

(38)     In order to ensure theimplementation of Articles 21 and 22 of this Regulation concerning examinationof draft national rules and rules in force, implementing powers should beconferred on the Commission.

(39)     In order to ensure uniformconditions for the implementation of Articles 29, 30, 31, and 51 of thisRegulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Thosepowers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 ofthe European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and generalprinciples concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of theCommission's exercise of implementing powers.

(40)     Itis necessary to implement certain principles regarding the governance of theAgency in order to comply with the Joint Statement and Common Approach agreedby the Inter-Institutional Working Group on EU decentralised agencies in July2012, the purpose of which is to streamline the activities of agencies andincrease their performance.

(41)     This Regulation respectsthe fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular bythe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,

1.5.        Grounds for theproposal/initiative

1.5.1.     Requirement(s) to be met inthe short or long term

Allow ERA to engage in new activities and continue to sufficientlycover existing tasks which are necessary to achieve fully interoperable andsafe internal railway market (Single European Railway Area).

1.5.2.     Added value of EU involvement

Current EU involvement (tasks of the European Railway Agency) islaid down in ERA Founding Regulation 881/2004. Moreover, Directive 2004/49/EC,Directive 2008/57/EC and Directive 2007/59/EC have directly and indirectlygiven other tasks to the Agency. In a similar manner, numerous secondarylegislation adopted by the Commission under the above-mentioned directives, inparticular the TSIs, CSMs and CSTs, have had an impact of the activities andwork of ERA. The current Regulation aims to combine all existing tasks of theAgency in one legal act, and extend the role of ERA to areas where is itjustified.

In line with the Transport White Paper of 2011 (Roadmap to a SingleEuropean Transport Area — Towards a competitive and resource efficienttransport system) and the results of the impact assessment accompanying currentinitiative, this proposal will provide further EU added value by eliminatingexisting technical and administrative barriers in the railway sector, notablyby:

- making railway vehicle authorisation and safety certification ofrailway undertakings more efficient (cheaper and faster) and impartial, bymoving them to the EU level;

- increasing the coherence and application of EU railway acquisby allowing the Agency to monitor the functioning of national authoritiesactive in railway interoperability and safety fields;

- facilitating faster progress towards truly common EU railwaystandards by increasing ERA’s action in reducing national railway rules;

- improving spending of EU funds for the railways (TEN, CohesionFund, Structural Funds, research programmes, etc.).

EU involvement through ERA allows for high added value thanks to:

- the use of a dedicated structure and qualified staff, some of whomare already available;

- positive experience with tried and tested methods (for example,using the established and operational network of national safety authorities);

- its objectivity and impartiality, highly appreciated bystakeholders.

1.5.3.     Lessons learned fromsimilar experiences in the past

Evaluation of the ERA Regulation and functioning of the Agency(2009-2010) and the general evaluation of the EU Agencies in 2009 both showedthe added value provided by the Agency.

This initiative seeks to apply (by revising the ERA Regulation) therecommendations from the ERA evaluation exercise, of the Court of Auditors,Internal Audit Service and the Joint Statement of the Commission, the EuropeanParliament and the Council on decentralised agencies, particularly with regardto internal structure, governance and functioning.

1.5.4.     Coherence and possiblesynergy with other relevant instruments

The proposal is in line with the Transport WhitePaper of 2011, in particular with its initiatives 1 and 19:

- "Achieve a single vehicle typeauthorisation and a single railway undertaking safety certification byreinforcing the role of the European Railway Agency (ERA)";

- "Enhance the role of ERA in the field ofrail safety, in particular its supervision on national safety measures taken byNational Safety Authorities and their progressive harmonisation".

The proposal is consistent with the EU railwayinteroperability and safety policy and legislation, in particular Directives2004/49 (Railway Safety Directive) and 2008/57 (Railway InteroperabilityDirective) which will also be amended as part of this initiative. All threerevised acts are interlinked and aim at removing remaining administrative andtechnical barriers, in particular by establishing a common approach to safetyand interoperability rules to increase economies of scale for railwayundertakings active across the EU, decreasing administrative costs andaccelerating administrative procedures, as well as to avoiding disguiseddiscrimination.

Moreover, this initiative is a part of a broader Fourth RailwayPackage which will aim — besides the objective described above — to open up thedomestic rail passenger market and optimise the governance of infrastructuremanagement; synergies are expected especially with regard to reducingdiscrimination in relation to access to infrastructure, thus lowering theaccess barriers for new entrants.

There is also an important synergy between the revised tasks of ERAand the TEN-T Executive Agency in relation to the evaluation of railwayprojects, in relation to increased value for money and efficiency of projectsfunded from the EU funds.

Besides, this initiative is consistent with and implementsrecommendations of the Court of Auditors, Internal Audit Service and the JointStatement of the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council ondecentralised agencies, as well as with the evaluation of ERA.

Finally, this initiative seeks to include in the ERA Regulation anumber of tasks and activities that were assigned to the Agency by other acts,particularly Directive 2007/59/EC, Commission Decisions on TechnicalSpecifications on Interoperability (TSIs) and Common Safety Methods (CSMs).

3.2.5.     Compatibility with thecurrent multiannual financial framework

–     ¨  Proposal/initiative is compatible the current multiannualfinancial framework.

–     x Proposal/initiative will entail reprogramming of the relevantheading in the multiannual financial framework.

Explain what reprogramming is required,specifying the budget lines concerned and the corresponding amounts.

The ERA budget line (06.02.08) will have to be adjusted to theamount specified in this financial statement (total of € 157.113 M for theperiod 2015-2020).

For the time being, only indicative amounts for the agencies areincluded in the financial framework. The indicative amount for ERA wasestimated before the results of the impact assessment and other calculations linkedwith this initiative were known.

For the period 2015-2020 the status of ERA will change from ‘cruisingspeed agency’ to ‘new tasks agency’.

Specify the method forcalculating the impact on revenue.

Some of the new tasks envisaged for ERA (safety certificates,vehicle authorisations for placing on the market and authorisations for placingin service of trackside control-command and signalling sub-systems) will allowfor charging the external applicants for issuing them.

According to the impact assessment, these new tasks will start in2017 and the revenue for ERA was calculated in the following way:

- cost of issuing a safety certificate: €0.01m

- cost of issuing a vehicle authorisation: €0.017m

- cost of issuing an authorisations for placing in serviceof trackside control-command and signalling sub-system: €0.05m

- respective numbers of all types of decisions issued eachyear are provided in table 3.2.3.

Summary of method of calculation:

The fees set out in the impact assessment report have been calculatedby taking the average of the current fees paid by operators wishing to obtain asafety certificate or gain vehicle authorisation in the EU; a similar approachwas used in case of authorisations for placing in service of tracksidecontrol-command and signalling sub-system. There was a large variation in thefees paid, and also a substantial difference between the fees paid in EU15Member States (about €20,000 for safety certificates and €28,000 forauthorisations) and the fees paid in EU12 Member States (about €3,000 forsafety certificates and €17,000 for authorisations). In determining the futurevalue of these fees it was assumed that, given: the cost of staff in theAgency, the more streamlined processes of dealing with the applications, avalue close to the mid-point of the low average and the high average would bethe most appropriate going forward.

It is important to note that the calculations set out for the feesare average across all types of safety certificates and vehicle authorisations;4 types of safety certificates and 20 types of vehicle authorisations wereidentified in the IA support study. Although the “centralisation” process withERA will lead to the number of types of certificates and authorisationsfalling, there will still be multiple categories. For example, there will stillbe a different process for the authorisation of a locomotive and a wagon. Assuch the fees will need to be differentiated for these two categories. Inparticular, the fees for wagon authorisation will be lower than the average andthe fees for locomotives and multiple units will be higher.

The number (price per authorisation/certificate) that was calculatedin the impact assessment report is meant to be an average, it would be up tothe Agency to define the exact fees for the different categories with the aimof ensuring that the average of the fees collected was equal, or greater thanthis average. However, the aim of the calculation is to provide a realistic butconservative estimation of revenues for the Agency, and it is not excluded thatthe fees to be charged can actually lead to a higher average value, ifnecessary and justified.

In terms of the number of authorisations and certificates, thesewere calculated starting from the current level of authorisations andcertifications. For future years, in relation to safety certificates, it wasassumed that the number of new entrants into the market would lead to anincrease in the number of safety certificates issued over time while the factthat there may be a change in the types of safety certificates could decreasethat number. Therefore, as a conservative estimate it was assumed that there isno change in the total annual number of safety certificates.

For vehicle authorisations the approach was slightly different: themodel starts from existing authorisation levels as provided by stakeholders andvarious studies. However, while there are likely to be more new entrants andtherefore in absolute terms more vehicles to authorise, new entrants are morelikely to stick with proven technology and as such with the rolling stock thathas already been certified. Furthermore, as the industry standardises, infuture there are likely to be fewer types of vehicles to authorise, leading toa slight fall in the number of authorisations. Once again, the model dividedthe assessment into EU15 and EU12 Member States.

DG MOVE considers that the calculations are robust and properly basedon existing and verifiable data obtained from stakeholders and the EuropeanRailway Agency. More information on methodology is provided in the impactassessment report accompanying this proposal, in particular its Annex VII.
