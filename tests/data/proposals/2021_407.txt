2021/0407(COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 and repealing 11 legal acts in the field of national accounts

(Text with EEA relevance)

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

•

Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

Regulation (EU) No 549/2013

,

which established the revised European System of Accounts (ESA 2010),

includes a conceptual basis (Annex A) and a transmission programme of data to be transmitted to Eurostat (Annex B). Since the introduction of ESA 2010 in 2014, there has been an evolution in

a key statistical classification

upon which it is based (a new Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose

, or COICOP

) and also

an evolution in the needs of users for national accounts data.

The Commission therefore believes that it is appropriate to amend Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 to update references to the COICOP classification and to update the transmission programme to reflect new user needs

In addition, the Commission

believes that it is opportune to repeal 1

1

legal acts relating to the previous European System of Accounts (ESA 1995)

, as these acts are no longer relevant

.

•

Consistency with existing policy provisions in the

policy area

The proposal is fully consistent with existing statistical provisions in Union legislation.

•

Consistency with other Union policies

The national accounts data which are prepared and transmitted under Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 are widely used for Union policy purposes and the revisions proposed will enhance the availability of data for users.

2.

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

•

Legal basis

Article 338 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides the legal basis for European statistics. Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Parliament and the Council adopt measures to ensure that statistics are produced where this is necessary to enable the Union to perform its role. Article 338 TFEU sets out the requirements for producing European statistics necessary for the performance of the activities of the Union, which must meet certain standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality without entailing excessive burdens on economic operators.

•

Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)

The subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not fall within the exclusive competence of the Union.

The proposal for this Regulation has been drafted with a view to retaining the relevance of the ESA 2010 with respect to its conceptual basis and to its transmission programme. Member States acting independently cannot sufficiently achieve the objectives of the proposed action with the view of ensuring comparability, reliability and exhaustiveness. Action can be taken more efficiently at EU level, on the basis of an EU legal act.

The Union may therefore adopt measures in this area in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty

•

Proportionality

The proposal complies with the proportionality principle. The need to update the link to a key classification, and to address user needs in the transmission programme, can be met through a limited amendment to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the regulation proposed confines itself to the minimum required to achieve its objective and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.

•

Choice of the instrument

Given the objectives and content of the proposal and the fact that this is a proposal amending an existing regulation, a regulation is the most appropriate instrument.

3.

RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

•

Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks

of existing legislation

Based on Commission standards, Eurostat’s system for evaluating existing legislation, including the evaluation of the European Statistical Programme

was followed, and formed a central part of the whole process. In addition

,

user surveys are conducted every year in order to obtain better knowledge about users, their needs and their satisfaction with the services provided by Eurostat. Evaluation results are used by Eurostat to improve the process of producing statistical information and its statistical output. They feed into various strategic plans, such as the work programme and the management plan.

A “Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of ESA 2010” was adopted on 29 June 2018 (COM(2018)506 final). In addition, several expert meetings have taken place with Member States and major stakeholders. In particular, the main stakeholders of ESA 2010 are Commission services, Member States, and EU and international organisations like the ECB and the OECD, which have been closely involved in developments and discussions. There is a consensus among practitioners that minor changes in the ESA 2010 Regulation are necessary. This became evident after Eurostat carried out a prioritisation survey at the beginning of 2018 and was confirmed in the conclusions of several subsequent expert groups on national accounts, particularly of the Directors of Macroeconomic Statistics and the dedicated task force on ESA 2010 cross-domain consistency.

•

Stakeholder consultations

Considering that the proposed amendment of Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 would not have any significant impact on society or the economy (see the explanation below), the Commission (Eurostat) consulted the European Statistical System Committee, as the national statistical institutes (NSIs) are responsible for coordinating all activities relating to European statistics at national level.

•

Collection and use of expertise

The issues underlying the proposal were discussed in meetings of the Directors of Macroeconomic Statistics (DMES), and its sub-groups, over 2020-21 and two rounds of written consultations were carried out. The input of major stakeholders in the European Commission services and outside (for example, the European Central Bank) was obtained. Furthermore there was a discussion with the Economic and Financial Committee’s Sub-Committee on Statistics in June 2021.

The European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) adopted an opinion at its meeting on 29 October 2021.

•

Impact assessment

No impact assessment was conducted, as the proposal does not have significant economic, social or environmental consequences and imposes no additional burden on businesses or the public.

•

Regulatory fitness and simplification

The proposal meets the simplification objectives of the REFIT programme partly by synchronising data transmission for GNI own resources with data transmission for other national accounting purposes, partly by switching to ESA 2010 for own resources in order to avoid Member States producing a double set of accounts, one on ESA 2010 and one on ESA 95.

Since the proposal only affects the national accountants in Member States, businesses are unaffected by the proposal.

•

Fundamental rights

Not applicable.

4.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

No supplementary budgetary resources are needed.

5.

OTHER ELEMENTS

•

Implementation plans and

monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements

As the proposed amendments are based on the existing voluntary data transmissions and those based on gentlemen’s agreements, implementation would be limited to including the new provisions in the legislation, and will be monitored as legally required.

•

Explanatory documents (for directives)

None

•

Detailed explanation of

the

specific provisions of the proposal

The proposal relates to an amendment of Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 in two respects:

i) Amendments to Annex A (the conceptual basis of ESA 2010)

The national accounts are based on internationally recognised statistical classifications, which ensure the comparability of data between countries. These classifications are periodically updated to improve their relevance for users. The Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP), was updated in 2018 and the references in Annex A to COICOP must be amended to reflect the updated classification.

The opportunity is also taken to update Annex A to correct minor textual inconsistencies that have been identified during its implementation in Member States.

ii) Amendments to Annex B (the transmission programme of ESA 2010)

Given the importance of national accounts data for policy purposes and broader user needs in the European Union, developments in the needs of these users must be taken into account. The proposal reflects these evolving user needs and in particular the following:

·

Expanding the availability of Government Finance Statistics, notably in respect of interactions with the institutions and bodies of the EU and the structure of government debt.

·

Providing an updated legislative basis for the transmission of quarterly non-financial accounts for general government at t+3 months delay. The data is being transmitted by Member States on a voluntary basis.

·

Improvement of the timeliness of the transmission of some tables, for example the transmission of annual financial accounts at t+4 months delay and the transmission of COFOG data at t+11 months delay. The latter is expected to facilitate its use in policy processes.

·

Strenghening the consistency across tables

, notably

by

amending the

deadline arrangements for transmission of quarterly non-financial sector accounts data.

·

Providing a legislative basis for

the

voluntary

transmission of

statistics which had been transmitted by Member States on a

gentlemen’s agreement

basis

in the past, for example GDP and employment flash estimates at t+30 and t+45 days delay.

The proposal also provides for the improvement of the availability of metadata accompanying national accounts data, and to strengthen the consistency of data between tables, particularly for quarterly data.

In addition, t

he pro

posal

ta

kes the opportunity to repeal 1

1

legal acts which relate to the former Europe

a

n System of Accounts (ESA 1995) and are no longer relevant since ESA 2010 has been implemented.

2021/0407 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 and repealing 11 legal acts in the field of national accounts

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338 (1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European

Central Bank

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)

Regulation (EU

)

No 549/2013 of the

European Parliament and of the Council

, which established the revised European System of Accounts (ESA 2010),

contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for dra

wing up the accounts of the Mem

ber States for the statis

tical requirements of the

Union

, in order to obtain comparable results between Member States.

(2)

Annex A to Regulation (E

U

) No 549/2013 provides for the

methodology

for the drawing up of the accounts of the Member States.

(3)

During the application of

Regulation (EU

)

No 549/2013

, minor textual inconsistencies have been identified in Annex A

to that Regulation

, and those inconsistencies should be corrected.

(4)

Annex B to Regulation (E

U

) No 549/2013 (the “transmission programme”) provides for a set of tables of national accounts data to be transmitted for

Union

purposes within specified time limits.

(5)

The transmission programme of national accounts data should be updated to take into account changing user needs and new policy priorities, and the development of new economic activities in the Union.

(6)

The

49th Session of the United Nations Statistical Commission considered and endorsed the revised classification for the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP 2018), as the internationally accepted standard.

Regulation (EU

)

No 549/2013

makes reference to the previous classification (COICOP 1999) in both Annex A and

Annex

B, and therefore

those

references

should

be updated.

(7)

Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(8)

Following the

entr

y

into force

of

Regulation (EU

)

No 549/2013

and of

Regulation (EU) 2019/516 of the European Parliament and of the Council

,

eleven

legal acts based on the previous European System of Accounts

, established by

Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96

,

are no longer relevant.

The measures set out in this Regulation should replace those of

Regulation

s

(EC) No 359/2002

,

(EC) No 1267/2003

,

(EC) No 1392/2007

,

(EC) No 400/2009

,

(EC) No 1221/2002

,

(EC) No 501/2004

and

(EC) No 1161/2005

of the European Parliament and of the Council

,

Council Regulation (EC) No 1222/2004

and

Regulation (EC) No 264/2000

and

Decision

s

2002/990/EC

and

98/715/EC

of the

Commission

.

Those acts should therefore

be repealed

.

(9)

This

Re

gulation

shall enter

into force on 1

September 2024

to coincide with the agreed timing for harmonised national accounts benchmark revisions in Member States.

This does not prevent Member St

ates from compiling

their statistics in accordance with the amended annexes before that general application date

.

(10)

Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised national accounts data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at

Union

level, the

Union

may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty

on European Union

. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective

.

(11)

The European Statistical System Committee

has been consulted

.

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 shall be amended by the text set out in Annex 1 to this Regulation.

Article 2

Annex B to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 shall be replaced by Annex 2 to this Regulation.

Article 3

The legal acts set out in Annex 3 to this Regulation are repealed.

Article 4

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the

Official Journal of the European Union

.

It shall apply from 1 September 2024.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Paragraph 9.61 is replaced by the following:

“However, the analytical properties of product-by-product tables and industry-by-industry tables do not differ significantly. The differences between product-by-product tables and industry-by-industry tables are caused by the existence of a generally limited amount of secondary production. In practice, analytical uses of input-output tables implicitly assume an industry technology, no matter how the tables have originally been compiled. Furthermore, in practice, any product-by-product table is a manipulated industry-by-industry table, as it still contains all the KAU and enterprise characteristics of the supply and use tables.”

Paragraph 17.148 is replaced by the following:

“If government assumes the responsibility for pension provision for the employees of a non-government unit through an explicit transaction, any payment by the non-government unit needs to be recorded as pre-paid social contributions (F.89). There is further discussion of this type of arrangement in paragraphs 20.273 to 20.275.”

29.

Paragraph 17.165 is replaced by the following:

“The discount rate applied to estimates of future pension benefits in the case of accrued-to-date entitlements is one of the most important assumptions to be made in the modelling of pension schemes, since its accumulated impact over many decades can be very large. The discount rate from a chosen approach may change over time, which would lead to revaluations in the accounts.”

Capital expenditure

In the ESA central framework, net lending/net borrowing (B.9) is the balancing item of the capital account. The balancing item of general government in the ESA GFS presentation is identical to the net lending/net borrowing (B.9). This box explains why.

The ESA central framework

The first account is the production account, and therefore the first resource of an institutional sector in the ESA is its output. As the majority of services provided by government are not sold at economically significant prices and so are non-market, government output is measured by convention as the sum of production costs.

Similarly, final collective consumption expenditure, consisting of services provided to the community by government such as general services, defence, safety and public order, are measured as the sum of production costs. Also by convention, collective consumption expenditure (P.32) is equal to the actual final consumption (P.4) of government.

Final individual consumption expenditure of households provided directly by government on a non-market basis is also measured by its production costs.

As a result, two types of flows are 'imputed' in the ESA accounts of government:

(1)

on the resources side, the non-market output, other (P.132) recorded in the production account;

(2)

on the uses side, the actual final consumption (P.4) and the social transfers in kind — non-market production (D.631). They are recorded in the redistribution of income in kind account, and in the use of adjusted disposable income account.

Each imputed flow is equal to the sum of actual flows: the production costs. These two types of imputed flows, on the resource side and on the uses side, balance in the ESA sequence of accounts.

The ESA GFS presentation of statistics

The same basic transaction categories are used in the ESA GFS presentation, but mainly on the basis of actual monetary flows, to obtain the total revenue and the total expenditure of government. Only a selection of imputed flows is taken into account: imputed social contributions and capital transfers in kind.

Eliminating from the resources side the non-market output (P.132) to obtain total revenue, and eliminating from the uses side the actual final consumption (P.4=P.32) and the social transfers in kind — non-market production (D.631) to obtain total expenditure, results in the same balancing item: the net lending/net borrowing (B.9).

The only social transfers in kind that are accounted for in the GFS aggregate total expenditure of government are social transfers in kind provided to households via market producers (D.632), as they are subject to real payments of government units. Those transactions are also to be added to the sum of production costs (equal to non-market output, other — P.132) to obtain the final consumption expenditure of the general government.

P.3 = P.132 + D.632

”

35.

Paragraph 20.90 is replaced by the following:

“Subsidies received by government units consist only of other subsidies on production. When received by producing entities belonging to general government, subsidies on products are included in the valuation of the output and sales at basic prices.”

36.

Paragraph 20.130 is replaced by the following:

“The repurchase by a unit of a liability is recorded as redemption in liabilities and not as an acquisition of assets. Likewise, at a subsector or sector level, the purchase by a government unit of a liability issued by another unit of the subsector in question will be presented in the consolidated presentation, as redemption of liability by that subsector or sector.”

37.

Paragraph 20.158 is replaced by the following:

“Taxes or subsidies paid by one government unit or entity to another are not to be consolidated. Taxes or subsidies on products cannot be consolidated in the system because there is no counterpart sector transactor in the ESA for such transactions; the relevant amounts are not separately recognised as expenditure and revenue (respectively) and are instead included in, or excluded from, the value of the intermediate consumption or of the sales.”

38.

Paragraph 21.22 is replaced by the following:

“The valuations of assets at fair value not only provide a better picture of the balance sheet than valuations at historic cost but they also generate more data on holding gains/losses.”

39.

Paragraph 22.13 is replaced by the following:

“In Coicop 15 main categories are distinguished:

(a) food and non-alcoholic beverages;

(b) alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics;

(c) clothing and footwear;

(d) housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels;

(e) furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance;

(f) health;

(g) transport;

(h) information and communication;

(i) recreation, sport and culture;

(j) education services;

(k) restaurants and accommodation services;

(l) insurance and financial services;

(m) personal care, social protection and miscellaneous goods and services;

(n) individual consumption expenditure of non-profit institutions serving households; and

(o) individual consumption expenditure of general government.

The first 13 categories sum up total individual consumption expenditure by households. The last two identify individual consumption expenditure by the non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) and general government sectors, i.e. their social transfers in kind. Together all 15 items represent actual final consumption by households.”

40.

Paragraph 22.14 is replaced by the following:

“The individual consumption expenditure of NPISHs and general government is broken down into five common sub-categories reflecting major policy issues: housing, health, recreation and culture, education and social protection. These are also Coicop functions for the individual consumption expenditure by households; social protection is a sub-category of 13 personal care, social protection and miscellaneous goods and services. As a consequence, Coicop also shows for each of these five common sub-categories, the role of private households, government and non-profit institutions serving households. For example, it can describe the role of government in providing housing, health and education.”

41.

Paragraph 22.16 is replaced by the following:

“The classification of government expenditure by function (COFOG) is a major tool for describing and analysing government finance. The 10 major divisions distinguished are:

(a) general public services;

(b) defence;

(c) public order and safety;

(d) economic affairs;

(e) environmental protection;

(f) housing and community amenities;

(g) health;

(h) recreation, culture and religion;

(i) education; and

(j) social protection.

The classification is used to classify individual and collective consumption expenditure by the government. However, it also serves to illustrate the role of other types of expenditure such as subsidies, investment grants and social benefits, for pursuing policy purposes.”

42.

Paragraph 23.05 is replaced by the following:

“Apart from COFOG and Coicop, the functional classifications include also COPNI (classification of the purposes of non-profit institutions serving households) and COPP (classification of outlays of producers by purpose). These classifications are used for functional analysis of the expenditure by corporations, government, households and non-profit institutions serving households and for functional satellite accounts.”

(1)

For a detailed description of the precise requirements, please refer to the specific tables.

Deadlines in brackets only apply in particular cases.

2.

Member States shall transmit all compulsory data for publication by the Commission (Eurostat) by the planned release dates of the European aggregates. Where the data transmitted cannot be disseminated due to statistical confidentiality considerations, the true value shall be sent with the flags agreed for statistical primary or secondary confidentiality. With exception of embargo dates, the application of other flags restricting the publication shall be justified and explained with metadata.

3.

Member States shall transmit all data in accordance with the concepts and definitions specified in Annex A to this Regulation. When the data transmitted deviate from the concepts and definitions, the observations affected shall be sent with a flag indicating that the definition differs.

4.

Member States shall transmit all data in accordance with the quality criteria specified in Article 4(1) of this Regulation.

5.

Member States and the Commission (Eurostat) shall coordinate the release dates of the accounts. Where national publication dates are subsequent to the deadlines for transmission of data to the Commission (Eurostat), the data shall be sent with a flag indicating the temporary embargo on publication as well as the embargo date and time for dissemination.

6.

The specification of embargo dates that are subsequent to the publication date for European aggregates shall be avoided to the extent possible.

Reference periods

7.

Member States shall transmit the entire compulsory time series to the Commission (Eurostat) at each deadline including data that have not been revised unless stated otherwise in specific individual tables.

Where the data transmitted have breaks in the time series, the value of the reference period concerned shall be sent with a flag indicating this break.

8.

If Member States have time series longer than the compulsory reference periods specified in the data tables, they may transmit the entire series on a voluntary basis.

Metadata

9.

The specific requirements of metadata for each table will be agreed between the Commission (Eurostat) and Member States through consultations with the relevant technical groups, and

– within the context of the Transmission programme -

should avoid the duplication of requests of the same information collected in other processes and tables.

10.

Member States shall inform the Commission (Eurostat) of major methodological or other changes that affect the data transmitted. This information shall be provided in the form of metadata accompanying the transmitted data allowing the Commission (Eurostat) to assess the changes and inform users of such changes. Where the metadata concern confidential information, Member States shall inform the Commission (Eurostat) that the relevant text in the metadata cannot be disseminated.

11.

Metadata on methods and sources shall be sent when the method and sources are implemented in the transmitted data table and each time when a change takes place. These metadata shall provide short explanations on the methods and source data used to compile the table in line with Annex A to this Regulation.

12.

Metadata on deviations from concepts and definitions shall be sent with each data transmission only when the concepts and definitions specified in Annex A to this Regulation are not implemented. These metadata shall provide short explanations on the concepts and definitions actually applied in the transmitted data and the reasons why the concepts and definitions specified in Annex A to this Regulation are not implemented.

13.

Metadata on major events such as major data revisions, data inconsistencies, outliers, breaks in time series as well as unusual zero and negative values shall be sent only when such events occur in the transmitted data. These metadata shall provide short explanations on the reasons why the event is observed in the transmitted data and which variables and reference periods are affected.

14.

In all cases, metadata on routine revisions shall provide explanations on the reasons for updating the time series and the variables affected.

15.

Metadata on data inconsistencies shall provide short explanations regarding the reasons for the lack of consistency of variables within a data table, between the annual and quarterly frequencies of data tables where applicable and between identical variables of accounts reported across data tables for each given data transmission when differences are present.

16.

Metadata on seasonal adjustment shall be sent once when a method is implemented in the transmitted data and each time when the method is updated. These metadata shall provide short explanations regarding the general characteristics of the seasonal adjustment method, i.e. direct or indirect approach, seasonal adjustment method and associated software, presence of calendar effects and benchmarking to annual data.

17.

Upon request by the Commission (Eurostat), Member States shall provide clarifications on the transmitted metadata and include other information of relevance to data users.

18.

Variables that are not applicable in a Member State shall be transmitted with the appropriate flag. Explanation shall be provided where requested by the Commission (Eurostat).

Transmission deadlines

19.

The data tables accompanied by metadata shall be transmitted by the specific deadlines for each table.

20.

Data shall be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) every time they are published by the national authority no later than the day they are published.

21.

If Member States become aware of errors in the transmitted data, they shall inform the Commission (Eurostat) immediately and transmit the corrected data as soon as the error can be corrected.

22.

If a Member State transmits complete datasets in line with the quality criteria referred to in Article 4(1) of this regulation ahead of the deadline, no retransmission of data is required at the deadline unless stated otherwise in specific individual tables.

Consistency

23.

The data transmitted in a table shall be internally consistent. The values that are transmitted for the same variable in different data tables should be numerically consistent when they have the same deadline or they are retransmitted at the same deadline with other tables.

24.

The sum of the quarterly values of a variable not adjusted by seasonal and calendar effects in a table with quarterly data shall be numerically consistent for any reference year with the same variable in a corresponding table with annual data, when the corresponding tables have the same deadline.

Tables 1Q and 1A — Quarterly (Q) and annual (A) national accounts main aggregates

.

T1A data shall be reported at t+2 months and t+9 months and T1Q at t+2 months after the reference period. The tables shall be re-transmitted at t+3 months if differences with table 801 are significant. T1Q shall be consistent with T1A at t+9 months.

* The five additional tables mentioned below are required on a five-yearly basis (for reference years ending with 0 or 5). Transmission of these five additional tables is compulsory at current prices and voluntary in previous year's prices.

The five tables are:

- use table at basic prices (made of row-blocks (1) – (7)).

- use table for domestic output at basic prices (made of row-blocks (1) and (2))

- use table for imports at basic prices (made of row-blocks (1) and (2)).

- table of trade and transport margins (made of row-blocks (1) and (2)).

- table of taxes less subsidies on products (made of row-blocks (1) and (2)).

(1) The concept to apply to the data by products in supply and use tables and input-output tables is the domestic concept. Adjustments to the national concept (direct purchases abroad by residents and purchases on the domestic territory by non-residents) are included as row totals in part (3) of the table. Final consumption expenditure by households by products does not include direct purchases abroad by residents. Final consumption expenditure by households by products includes purchases on the domestic territory by non-residents. Exports fob by products do not include purchases on the domestic territory by non-residents.

(2) Only in current prices.

(3) Exports should be broken down into:

j) S.21 Member States and institutions and bodies of the European Union, j1) S.2I Member States of the euro area, the European Central Bank and other institutions and bodies of the euro area, j2) S.21 - S.2I Member States not in the euro area and institutions and bodies of the European Union (except the European Central Bank and other institutions and bodies of the euro area), and k) S.22 Non-member countries and international organisations non-resident in the EU, taking into account that:

•

They should represent the actual composition at the end of each reference period (‘evolving composition’);

•

Member States of the euro area have to provide all breakdowns as mentioned under j), j1), j2) and k); Member States not in the euro area should provide the breakdowns as mentioned under j) and k), but the provision of the breakdowns mentioned under j1) and j2) is voluntary.

(4) On a voluntary basis.

Seasonally and calendar adjusted data can be reported on a voluntary basis, with exception of the following items at S.13 level: total revenue (TR), total expenditure (TE) and net lending (+) / net borrowing (-) (B.9). The latter are to be reported on a compulsory basis with a deadline of t+107 days after the end of the reference period. Member States shall provide metadata on seasonal adjustment comprising a short description of the general characteristics of the seasonal adjustment method, i.e. direct or indirect approach, seasonal adjustment method and associated software, presence of calendar effects, benchmarking to annual data as well as the specific models used. Eurostat shall provide technical help on seasonal adjustment in accordance with Member States requirements.

Subsector data shall be reported as consolidated in items property income (D.4), other current transfers (D.7) and capital transfers (D.9) (and their sub-items; partly consolidated in total expenditure and total revenue - TE and TR) within each subsector but not between subsectors). Sector S.13 data equals the sum of subsector data, except for items D.4, D.7 and D.9 (and their sub-items and aggregations) which shall be consolidated between subsectors.

Data shall be based on direct information available from basic sources, such as for example public accounts or administrative sources, representing, for taxes on production and imports (D.2r), current taxes on income and wealth, etc. (D.5r), capital taxes (D.91r), actual social contributions (D.611 and D.613 combined) as well as social benefits (D.62p), at least 90 % of the amount of the category. Direct information shall be completed by coverage adjustments, if needed, and by conceptual adjustments in order to bring quarterly data in line with ESA 2010 concepts.

The quarterly data and the corresponding annual data reported in table 2 and data reported under Regulation (EC) No 479/2009, shall be consistent with exception of vintage differences at non-coinciding transmission deadlines.

Member States shall provide the Commission (Eurostat) with a description of the sources and methods used to compile the data at the same time as they start to transmit quarterly data according to the timetable provided for by this Regulation. Any revision of the initial description of the sources and methods used to compile the quarterly data shall be provided to the Commission (Eurostat) when the revised data are communicated.

Data transmissions shall be accompanied by a reporting on major events and major revisions.

Output

(1) The data for columns G and H should comprise three datasets based on the actuarial calculations carried out for those pension schemes. The datasets should reflect the outcomes of a sensitivity analysis with respect to the most important parameters of the calculations, as agreed by statisticians on the one hand and experts in ageing populations working under the auspices of the Economic Policy Committee on the other. The parameters to be used shall be clarified in accordance with Article 2(3) of this Regulation.

(2)

Such other non-defined contribution schemes, often described as hybrid schemes, have both a defined benefit and a defined contribution element.

(3) Schemes organised by general government for its current and former employees.

(4) These are non-autonomous defined benefit schemes whose pension entitlements are recorded in the core national accounts.

(5) Counterpart data for non-resident households will only be shown separately when pension relationships with the rest of the world are significant.

(6) These supplements represent the return on members' claims on pension schemes, both through investment income on defined contribution schemes' assets and for defined benefit schemes through the unwinding of the discount rate applied.

(7) A more detailed split of these positions has to be provided for columns G and H based on the model calculations carried out for these schemes.
