Brussels, 30.3.2022

COM(2022) 143 final

2022/0092(COD)

Proposal for a

DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Directives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards empowering consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and better information

(Text with EEA relevance)

{SEC(2022) 166 final} - {SWD(2022) 85 final} - {SWD(2022) 86 final}

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

1.1.

Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Articles 114 and 169 TFEU) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 38) require a high level of consumer protection in the EU. EU consumer legislation also contributes to the proper functioning of the single market. It aims to make business-to-consumer relations fair and transparent and ultimately support the welfare of European consumers and the EU economy.

This proposal aims at

enhancing consumer rights by

amending two directives that protect the

interest of consumers

at

Union level

:

the

Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC

1

and

the Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EU

2

.

More specifically, t

he proposal

aims to

contribute to a

circular, clean and green

EU

economy

by

enabling

consumers to take

informed purchasing decisions

and

therefore

contribut

e

to

more

sustainable consumption

.

It

also targets

unfair

commercial

practices that mislead consumers away from sustainable consumption choices

. Furthermore, it

ensures a

better and

more

co

nsist

ent

application of EU

consumer

rules

.

The

proposal

was

one of the initiatives set out

in

the New Consumer Agenda

3

and

the Circular Economy Action Plan

4

and

follows up on

the

European

Green Deal

5

.

Empowering consumers and providing them with cost-saving opportunities is a key building block of th

e sustainable product policy framework. This is to be achieved through the

improved

participation of consumers in the circular economy, in particular by

providing better information on

the

durability and reparability of

certain

products to

consumers

before concluding the contract

and stepping up the protection of consumers against

unfair

commercial

practices

that

prevent sustainable purchases, such as

:

·

greenwashing

practices

(i.e. misleading environmental claims)

,

·

early obsolescence

practices (i.e.

premature

failures

of goods

)

, and

·

the use of unreliable and non-transparent sustainability labels and information tools

.

More precisely, the proposal aims

at

:

·

P

rovi

ding

information on the

existence

and

length

of a producer’s commercial guarantee of durability

for all

types of

goods

,

or the absence of

such guarantee

in case of energy-using goods

.

·

P

roviding

information on the availability of free software updates

for all

goods

with digital elements

, digital content and digital services

.

·

P

rovi

ding

information on the reparability of products, through a repa

rability

score

or other relevant repair information

, where available, for all

types of

goods

.

·

Ensuring that traders do not mislead consumers about

environmental and social impacts, durability and reparability

of products

.

·

Ensuring that a trader can make

an environmental claim related to future environmental performance

only when this involves clear commitments.

·

Ensuring that a trader cannot advertise

benefits for consumers that are considered as a common practice in the relevant market

.

·

Ensuring that a trader can only compare products, including through a sustainability information tool, if they provide

information about the method of the comparison, the products and suppliers covered, and the measures to keep information up to date

.

·

A ban on displaying a sustainability label which is not based on a certification scheme

or not established by public authorities

.

·

A ban of

generic

environmental claims used in marketing towards consumers

, where the

excellent

environmental

performance of the product or trader cannot be demonstrated

in accordance

with

Regula

tion (EC) 66/2010 (EU Ecolabel)

,

officially recognised eco

-

labelli

ng schemes in the Member States

,

or other applicable Union laws

, as relevant to the claim

.

·

A ban on making an environmental claim

about the entire product

,

when it actually concerns only a certain aspect of the product

.

·

A ban on presenting requirements imposed by law on all products within the relevant product category on the Union market as a distinctive feature of the trader’s offer.

·

A ban of certain practices related to the early obsolescence of goods.

These measures are needed to update existing consumer law to ensure consumers are protected and

can

actively

contribute to the green transition.

T

he Consumer Rights Directive

currently

requires traders to provide consumers w

ith information on

the main characteristics of the goods or services. It includes specific information requirements about the existence of the legal guarantee of conformity, as well as additional commercial guarantees.

However, as there is no requirement to provide information on the

absence

of commercial guarantees of durability, the Directive does not incentivise producers

sufficiently

to provide such guarantees to consumers

.

Research shows that

where

consumer products are offered

with

a commercial guarantee

, the information on such commercial guarantees, and the way that consumers are being charged, is often unclear, imprecise or incomplete

,

making it difficult for consumers to compare between products and to distinguish

the

commercial guarantee from the (compulsory) legal guarantee

6

.

This proposal will address this issue by ensuring that consumers are provided with information on the existence of a commercial guarantee of durability of more than two years, covering the entire good, whenever such information is made available by the producer.

Furthermore, the Directive does not contain specific requirements to provide information

to consumers

on the reparability of

goods

.

Rather

,

it

requires

only

information on

‘after sale services’

to be provided

on a

‘

where applicable

’

basi

s

.

This

information

,

which

would help promote the repair of goods

and therefore

be

particularly valuable in helping consumers contribute to a circular economy, is

largel

y missing at the point of sale

.

Recent studies show that up to 80% of EU consumers claim to have difficulty in finding

information on how easy it is to repair a product

7

.

The general

rules

in

the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive on misleading practi

ces can be

applied

to

greenwashing practices

when they negatively affect consumers

,

using

a case-by-case assessment.

However, t

here are no specific

rules

in the Directive or in its Annex I (

the

blacklist)

defining

such

practices as unfair

in

all circumstances.

Recent screening of websites by Consumer Protection Cooperation Network authorities to detect misleading

environmental

claims confirmed there is a need

to

strengthen the

rules

to facilitate enforcement in this area.

Furthermore, a recent Commission study

assessed 150 environmental claims and found that

a considerable share (53.3%) of them provide vague, misleading or unfounded information on products’ environmental characteristics

across the EU and in a wide range of product groups (both in advertisement as well as on the product)

8

.

The s

ame situation exists for

early obsolescence cases

.

The lack of specific rules and the need

to

assess the concrete effects of the practice on consumers makes it difficult to enforce the Directive in this area.

This is borne out by the fact that, in their reply to the Open Public Consultation consulted in preparation of this

proposal

, 76% of respondents mentioned that they had experienced an unexpected failure of a product in the past 3 years

9

.

1.2.

Consistency with existing

rules

Directive (EU) 2019/771

10

(Sale of Goods Directive) promotes durability of

goods

through the legal guarantee,

which

provides

certain

rights to

consumers

during

a

minimum two-year period

, which can be extended by Member States under certain conditions

.

It

also

provides for conditions under which a producer may offer a commercial guarantee

of durability

to a consumer

.

This proposal will increase transparency for consumers as regards commercial guarantees and will thereby also incentivise producers to offer commercial guarantees of durability longer than two years by obliging traders to provide information at the point of sale on the existence (or absence in the case of energy-using goods) and length of the commercial guarantees of durability provided by producers.

B

oth

the Sale of Goods Directive

and the Digital Content Directive

11

ensure

consumers are supplied with software updates so that a product remains in conformity for

the duration of the

contract

,

or alternatively for

a period of time which the consumer might reasonably expect

.

However, the comparability of products at the point of sale based on the availability of software updates is not addressed. This proposal will provide for an obligation to inform consumers before concluding the contract on the existence of software updates and the period for which the producer commits to provide them, when this information is provided by the producer. When there is already a commercial guarantee of durability offered for longer than two years, the information obligation for traders only remains for software updates when the duration is longer than the duration of the commercial guarantee of durability, to avoid unnecessary information for consumers.

As this proposal amends existing EU

consumer law

d

irectives, its provisions

will

be able to

rely on the full spectrum of enforcement mechanisms

in

existing EU consumer law

,

recently

strengthened

by

the Better enforcement and modernisation Directive

12

, the Representative Actions Directive

13

and the revised C

onsumer

P

rotection

C

ooperation

Regulation

14

.

1.3.

Consistency with other EU policies

With the exception of certain derogations, the two consumer law directives amended by this proposal, apply across all economic sectors. Due to their general scope, they apply to many aspects of business-to-consumer transactions that may also be covered by other, more specific EU legislation in different areas. The interplay between the different instruments of Union law is regulated by the

lex specialis

principle. Under this principle, the general consumer law directives apply whenever the relevant aspects of business-to-consumer transactions are not regulated by more specific provisions of EU law. Thus, the general consumer law directives work as a ‘safety net’, ensuring that a high level of consumer protection can be maintained in all sectors, complementing and filling gaps in sector-specific Union law.

Two other EU-level initiatives would complement this proposal: the Green Claims initiative and the Sustainable Products initiative.

The objective of the

Green Claims initiative will be to introduce further requirements in relation to environmental claims made about products and organisations, both when made by businesses towards consumers and by businesses towards other businesses.

The Sustainable Products

initiative

(SPI)

build

s

on the current Eco-design Directive

15

in order to

introduce sustainability

requirements

for products

sold in the EU

.

The three initiatives

are

mutually consistent and complementary.

2.

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

·

Legal basis

Consumer protection falls within the joint remit (‘shared competence’) of the EU and its member countries. As stipulated in Article 169 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), the EU must help protect the economic interests of consumers and promote their right to information and education, to safeguard their interests. This proposal is based on Article 114 which in accordance with Article 169(2)(a) is the legal basis for adoption of measures that contribute to attainment of objectives of Article 169 in the context of the completion of the internal market.

In addition to pursuing single market and consumer protection objectives, the proposal will also pursue a high level of environmental protection by unlocking opportunities for the circular, clean and green economy. As these environmental benefits are complementary to the primary objectives of consumer protection and completion of the single market, Article 114 TFEU on internal market completion, with due regard to Article 169 TFEU remains the appropriate legal basis.

·

Subsidiarity (for

shared

competence)

This proposal amends EU consumer protection rules, whose adoption has been deemed necessary and in line with the principle of subsidiarity. A better functioning single market cannot be achieved by national laws alone. EU consumer protection rules become increasingly relevant as the single market deepens, and the number of EU consumer transactions increases between Member States. The problems addressed by these proposed amendments are EU-wide problems with the same causes. Therefore, only action taken at EU level will be effective.

Within the EU, the volume and intensity of cross-border trade are high enough to make the efficient functioning of the single market vulnerable to inconsistent — or even merely divergent — policy choices by Member States. Moreover, traders can reach consumers across Member States' borders. This can create problems that national lawmakers and regulators are ill placed to address adequately by acting alone.

In the absence of EU-level action, national initiatives, while bringing certain benefits to consumers and the national markets, could lead to a fragmentation of the single market, in turn bringing legal uncertainty and raising compliance costs.

Directive 2005/29/EC ensures full harmonisation of national rules on unfair commercial practices that harm consumers' economic interests. Directive 2011/83/EU in principle provides full harmonisation of rules on pre-contractual information requirements.

Any new national legislation within the scope of these Directives would go against the fully harmonised legal framework. This proposal helps alleviate the difficulties faced by national authorities in enforcing the existing principle-based rules in Directive 2005/29/EC in such complex areas as misleading environmental claims, early obsolescence practices and non-transparent sustainability labels and sustainability information tools. By specifying further when and how such practices would qualify as unfair, it would increase the effectiveness of consumer protection within the EU.

This proposal also amends Directive 2011/83/EU by requiring traders to provide information on the durability and reparability of products before concluding a contract, to ensure consumers can make better-informed purchasing choices. This will ensure consumers can benefit from such information when buying products in the single market.

·

Proportionality

The measures in the proposal are proportionate to the objectives of enabling informed purchasing decisions by consumers, to promote sustainable consumption, eliminate unfair commercial practices by traders that cause damage to the sustainable economy and lead consumers away from sustainable consumption choices, and ensuring a better and more consistent application of EU consumer protection rules.

The requirement to provide information about the presence of a producer’s commercial guarantee of durability of more than two years is only needed when a producer makes this information available to the trader. Moreover, for energy-using goods, consumers should also be informed of the fact that the producer has not made that information available. Traders are only subject to this requirement in relation to energy-using goods for which durability can be reliably estimated and about which consumers are mostly interested to receive this information.

For goods with digital elements, the provision

of information about available software updates

is required only when updates are supplied for a period longer than the period covered by the producer’s commercial guarantee of durability, and when such information is provided to the trader by the producer. Furthermore, such information should only be provided in case of a single act of supply of the digital elements in question.

For digital services and digital content, the provision of

information about available software updates

is required only when such information is provided to the trader by the provider when the provider is different from the trader. Furthermore, such information should only be provided in case of a single act of supply of the digital service or content in question.

Providing

information on the reparability of products through a reparability score or other relevant repair information

is required at the point of sale only if a reparability score is already established for that product under EU law, or whenever other relevant repair information is made available by the producer. Traders are not obliged to inform consumers at the point of sale if no such information is available.

The

ban on generic environmental claims used in marketing towards consumers

is expected to bring significant benefits for consumers while limiting the burden on traders. Traders are allowed to make generic environmental claims in cases where the excellent environmental performance by products or traders can be demonstrated in accordance with Regulation (EC) 66/2010 (EU Ecolabel), by officially recognised eco-labelling schemes in the Member States in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EC) 66/2010, or in accordance with other applicable Union laws.

The

ban on making an environmental claim about the entire product when it actually concerns only a certain aspect of the product

is also expected to bring significant benefits for consumers while clarifying the rules for traders, ensuring a level playing field among them. It will allow traders to continue to make environmental claims about a certain aspect of a product as long as it is made clear to the consumer that the claim relates to a certain aspect and not to the whole product.

The

ban on practices related to the early obsolescence of products

is targeted at specific and well defined existing practices and aims at ensuring legal certainty for traders and facilitating enforcement, as enforcement authorities will not be required to prove that a product has been designed for early obsolescence, with the intention of stimulating the purchase of a new model.

·

Choice of instrument

As this proposal amends two existing Directives, the most appropriate instrument is a directive.

RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

·

Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks

o

n

existing legislation

In 2017, the EU Consumer and Marketing Law and the Consumer Rights Directive underwent a fitness check and evaluation, respectively. The findings from this exercise pointed primarily to the need to improve awareness and enforcement of the rules and opportunities for consumers to seek redress, to make the best of the existing legislation, and highlighted a limited range of necessary changes due to digitalisation.

Given the focus on enforcement and digitalisation, there were no specific conclusions

o

n the contribution of

EU

consumer

law

to sustainable consumption, an issue which gained further political prominence

some

years later with the announcement of the European Green Deal. Nevertheless, whenever possible and relevant, this instrument draws on the findings and conclusions collected in

th

e 2017

exercise

Stakeholder consultations

In preparing this proposal, the Commission consulted with stakeholders via:

–

a

feedback mechanism on the

i

;

–

an

online public consultation;

–

targeted consultations with key stakeholders

,

consisting of

about 150

in-depth interviews wi

national consumer associations;

–

–

a

n online consumer survey of

almost 12 000

in all EU countries

;

–

four expert workshops with

different

stakeholder

groups

.

The online Open Public Consultation

This open public consultation found that verifying the reliability of environmental claims about products was the biggest obstacle to improved consumer participation in the green transition and towards more sustainable consumption behaviour. Consumer organisations were more likely than business associations to identify this as an obstacle.

Most respondents had experienced the unexpected failure of a product in the last three years. ICT products were identified as most problematic, followed by small household appliances and clothing and footwear.

‘Information about the reparability of the product’ was identified as the option most likely to enable consumers to choose more sustainable products and participate in the circular economy. This was strongly favoured by public authorities and citizens, but not by companies/business organisations, who instead favoured the provision of ‘

information on the product’s life-cycle environmental and climate footprint

’. This was also rated as the second-best option overall.

Providing better information on products’ durability/lifespan was identified as the best option to empower consumers in the green transition. This was strongly favoured by consumer organisations and citizens, but not by company/business organisations or business associations, who favoured ‘

raising awareness about the role of consumers on circular economy and green transition

’.

Targeted consultation

In this consultation – conducted to expand on the feedback collected in the online Open Public Consultation, almost all stakeholders (except those representing industry) agreed with the view that consumers are not given, or do not have sufficient access to information on (i) products’ environmental impact, (ii) the lifespan of goods, (iii) product-specific features that may lead to early failure, and (iv) the availability of repair services spare parts and software updates/upgrades.

Most consumer organisations considered that consumers are subjected to ‘greenwashing’ and that ‘premature obsolescence’ occurs to some extent. Representatives from industry tended to disagree. The proliferation of sustainability labels was also identified as a problem by most stakeholder groups.

Computer-assisted telephone interview survey

Manufacturers and retailers were asked to indicate the scale of impact and cost of introducing various legal requirements on their organisation. The responses for each requirement were as follows:

·

‘

Provide information on aspects in the product’s design that can cause its early failure

’ would have the biggest impact and would be most costly.

·

‘

Stronger consumer protection against planned (intentional) obsolescence practices

’ would have the lowest impact

·

‘

Obligation to provide information on the duration of the commercial guarantee for all products

’ and

the

‘

Obligation to expressly inform the consumer that no commercial guarantee of durability

is provided for the given product

’ would be least costly.

Online consumer survey

The survey found that consumers appear to be open to participating in the green transition. Most respondents were unwilling to pay for information (e.g. via an app) on the durability and reparability of ‘durable goods’. Around half of respondents said they were willing to pay extra on top of the initial price for a product that lasts longer without having to be repaired, and a similar proportion said they were willing to pay extra for an identical product that lasts longer with minor/reasonable repairs. An even larger share said they were willing to pay extra for an identical product covered by a commercial guarantee that would cover the cost of repairs. The ‘

Perceived higher price of environmentally-friendly products

’ was identified as the main obstacle that prevents consumers from adopting more sustainable behaviours and ‘

Providing better information on products’ durability/lifespan

’ and ‘

Providing better consumer information on the life-cycle environmental and climate footprint of the product

’ were identified as the most effective options to help consumers choose more environmentally sustainable products.

Expert workshops

1

st

workshop

Collected views on the

extent of the problems

and

examples of effective action

. It validated many of the findings from the other strands of consultation. It was largely agreed that greenwashing occurs and that information on product durability can be difficult to obtain. Doubts were raised that products are intentionally designed to fail early.

2

workshop

Collected views of

industry associations

on how digital means can be used to provide product information. It highlighted some of the opportunities that digital tools (e.g. QR codes, e-labels) offer for conveying mandatory product information and simplifying product labels.

It also highlighted some of the challenges, particularly for SMEs who may need financial support to implement these tools and for vulnerable consumers who do not have access to, or who cannot use, them.

Collected the views of

consumer protection enforcement authorities

(CPC authorities) on enforcement challenges. Participants highlighted the difficulty of proving intent with regard to planned obsolescence.

Public authorities noted that they lack technical expertise to be able to enforce environmental claims, and were divided on whether enforcement of the current rules in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive is effective.

·

Impact assessment

This proposal is based on an

i

mpact

a

ssessment

17

. The

Commission’s

Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB) first issued a negative opinion

(

with comprehen

sive comments

)

on 5 February 2021

.

After a significant revision of the initial draft, the RSB provided a positive opinion with further comments on

17 September 2021

18

. Annex I

of

the

impact assessment

explains how the RSB comments were addressed.

The impact assessment identifies two problems divided into a number of sub-problems. The two problems identified are:

(1)

Consumers lack reliable information at the point of sale to make environmentally sustainable

consumption choices

.

(2)

Consumers face misleading commercial practices related to the sustainability of products

.

Problem 1 is further broken down into the sub-problems:

1.1)

Lack of reliable information on the environmental characteristics of products

1.2)

Lack of reliable information on the lifespan of goods

1.3)

Lack of reliable information about products’ reparability

Problem 2 is further broken down into the sub-problems:

2.1)

Consumers are sold products that do not last as long as they could or consumers expect (“early obsolescence”)

2.2)

Consumers are faced with unclear or

poorly

-substantiated environmental claims (‘greenwashing’)

from companies

2.3)

Consumers are faced with sustainability labels and digital information tools that are not always

transparent

or

credible

.

A number of policy options were considered for each individual sub-problem. On the basis of a multi-criteria analysis, complemented by a (partial) cost-benefit analysis, and a qualitative assessment of the proportionality of the various options considered, a combination of five preferred policy options were proposed to address these problems:

(1)

P

rovi

ding

information on the existence or absence of

information about

the existe

nce of

a producer’s commercial guarantee of durability and of the period of time during which free software updates are provided

(to address sub-problem 1.2)

(2)

Providing

a

reparability score

, or other relevant repair information

,

where applicable

/

available

(to address sub-problem 1.3)

(3)

B

an o

n

certain identified practices associated with early obsolescence

(to address sub-problem 2.1)

(4)

B

an o

n

unfounded

gener

ic

or vague environmental claims and

setting criteria for assessing the fairness of environmental claims to ensure their transparency and credibility towards consumers

(to address sub-problem 2.2)

(5)

S

etting criteria for assessing the fairness

of sustainability labels and digital information tools

,

to ensure the

y

are

transparen

t

and credib

le

for

consumers

(to address sub-problem 2.3)

Sub-problem 1.1

(lack of reliable information on products’ environmental characteristics)

It was considered that introducing mandatory information requirements on environmental characteristics would best be done by sectoral legislation, as the characteristics in question differ significantly according to product category. The impact assessment therefore did not propose a preferred policy option to address this sub-problem.

Sub-problem 1.2

(lack of reliable information on the lifespan of goods)

The preferred option would ensure consumers are better informed about the durability of the goods they purchase, as the producer’s commercial guarantee of durability is an excellent proxy for the durability of the good.

Furthermore, the obligation on traders to inform the consumer about the length of the guarantee, or the absence of a guarantee if that is the case, would stimulate traders to compete on the provision and length of such guarantees, thus indirectly stimulating the manufacturing of products with a longer lifespan.

Another option considered to address this sub-problem was an obligation to inform consumers about the expected lifespan of goods. However this was not selected as it was not deemed feasible to calculate an expected lifespan in a standardised manner for all the product types in scope.

Sub-problem 1.3

(lack of reliable information about products’ reparability)

The preferred policy option would ensure consumers will receive reliable information at the point of sale about the reparability of a good in the form of a reparability score, if one exists for that particular product category and is mandated under Union law.

If no such reparability score is applicable or available, this option would ensure consumers are provided with other relevant repair information (where available), such as the availability of spare parts (including a procedure for ordering them) or repair manuals.

Sub-problem 2.1

(products not lasting as long as they should)

The preferred option would ensure consumers are better protected against from goods or services being marketed without disclosing that they have been designed to become obsolete earlier than the consumer might expect.

The designation of specific practices as constituting ‘early obsolescence practices’ will facilitate the enforcement work of consumer protection authorities.

Another option considered to address this sub-problem was collecting evidence on early failures of products identified by authorised bodies. However this option was not selected as it was not deemed likely to bring significant benefits to consumers.

Sub-problem 2.2

(unclear or unfounded environmental claims)

The preferred option would ensure consumers are protected from greenwashing, since a certain standard will need to be met by those making such claims. It would also facilitate enforcement by consumer protection authorities.

Sub-problem 2.3

(unclear/unfounded sustainability labels/digital information tools)

The preferred option would ensure consumers are protected from being misled by such labels and tools.

Another option considered to address this sub-problem was pre-approval for sustainability labels and digital information tools via an EU body. However this option was not selected as the burden on traders was deemed to be disproportionate.

The combination of the preferred policy options is expected to increase consumer welfare by at least

EUR 12.5 – 19.4 billion

over a 15 year period (around

EUR 1 billion

per year on average). It will also bring benefits to the environment, with a partial estimation of the total saved

CO2e of

5 - 7 MtCO2e

over a 15 year period. At the same time, businesses will have to adjust, which is expected to

cost between EUR 9.1 – 10.4 billion

. This represents an average one off cost

per company

of between

EUR 556 - 568

, followed by an annual recurrent cost of between

EUR 64 - 79

for the period covered. On the other hand, businesses will also experience very important benefits related to level playing field as businesses that currently mislead consumers would have to align their practices with those that are truly sustainable. The

enforcement

of the preferred options on the part of public administrations is expected to cost on average about

EUR 440 000 – 500 000 per year

per Member State.

In order to ensure full coherence with other Commission initiatives in preparation, it was decided that some of the elements of the preferred policy options selected in the impact assessment to tackle sub-problem 2.2 (unclear or unfounded environmental claims) and sub-problem 2.3 (unclear/unfounded sustainability labels/digital information tools) will not be implemented via this initiative but via the other initiatives.

·

Regulatory fitness and simplification

The fitness check report published in

2017

showed that the general EU consumer legislation is not particularly burdensome,

either

in absolute terms

or

when compared

to other areas of EU regulation

19

. Therefore,

given

the benefits of EU legislation in protecting consumers and facilitating the

s

ingle

m

arket, these evaluations identified only a limited scope

f

or

burden reduction.

Given the focus on enforcement and digitalisation, there were no specific conclusions about the contribution made by EU consumer law to sustainable consumption. Nevertheless, whenever possible and relevant, this instrument draws on the findings and conclusions collected in that exercise.

·

Fundamental rights

The proposal is in accordance with Article 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, according to which the EU must ensure a high level of consumer protection. This will be ensured by

(a)

improv

ing

the reliability of durability and reparability information provided at the point of sale

, and

(b)

address

ing

misleading commercial practices related to greenwashing and the use of unreliable

and non-transparent

sustainability labels and sustainability information tools

, and early obsolescence

.

The clarification of what constitutes an unfair commercial practice as regards the making of environmental claims and the use of sustainability labels and sustainability information tools, and early obsolescence, will contribute to the implementation of Article 16 of the Charter, which guarantees the freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices.

Finally, by empowering consumers to make more environmentally sustainable purchasing decisions, the proposal respects the right to a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment, set out in Article 37 of the Charter.

Detailed explanation of the specific

rules

in

the proposal

Article 1 - Amendments to Directive 2005/29/EC

Article 1 of the proposal amends Directive 2005/29/EC by updating the list of product characteristics about which if a trader deceives a consumer it can be considered a misleading action. Two new commercial practices are also included in the list of actions which are to be considered misleading if they cause or are likely to cause the average consumers to take a transactional decision that they would not have otherwise taken. One new item is added to the list of information to be regarded as material in the case of specific commercial practices, the omission of which may cause the commercial practice in question to be regarded as misleading. Furthermore, the list of commercial practices which are considered unfair in all circumstances is extended to practices associated with the early obsolescence of products and greenwashing.

The list of product characteristics about which a trader should not deceive a consumer in Article 6(1) of Directive 2005/29/EC is amended to include ‘environmental or social impact, ‘durability’ and ‘reparability’. As regards the commercial practices to be considered misleading actions if they cause or are likely to cause the average consumers to take a transactional decision that they would not have otherwise taken,

two additional practices

are added in Article 6(2) of Directive 2005/29/EC:

–

making an environmental claim related to future environmental performance without clear,

objective and verifiable commitments and targets and a

n independent

monitoring system.

–

advertising benefits for consumers that are considered as a common practice in the relevant market.

In Article 7 of Directive 2005/29/EC, the list of information to be regarded as material in the case of specific commercial practices, the omission of which may cause the commercial practice in question to be regarded as misleading, is extended to include the following item:

–

w

here a trader provides

a service

which compares products

, including through a sustainability information tool, information about the method of the comparison,

the products which are the object of the comparison and the suppliers of those products,

and the measures to keep information up to date shall be regarded as material

.

The

ten additional commercial practices

added to Annex I of Directive 2005/29/EC which are to be considered unfair in all circumstances are:

–

Displaying a sustainability label which is not based on a certification scheme or

not

established by public authorities.

–

Making a generic environmental claim

for which

the trader

is not

able to demonstrate

recognised

excellent

environmental

performance

relevant to the claim

.

–

Making an environmental claim about the entire product when it actually concerns only a certain aspect of the product.

–

Presenting requirements imposed by law on all products in the relevant product category on the Union market as a distinctive feature of the trader’s offer.

–

Omitting to inform

the consumer

that a

software

update

will

negatively impact the use of goods with digital elements

or certain feature of those goods

even if the

software

update improves the function of

other

features.

–

Omitting to inform the consumer about the existence of a feature of

a

good

introduced to

limit its durability.

–

Claiming that a good has a certain durability

in terms of usage time or intensity

when it does not.

–

Presenting products as allowing repair when they do not

or omitting to inform the consumer that goods do not allow repair in accordance with legal requirements.

–

Inducing the consumer into replacing the consumables

of a

good

earlier than for technical reasons

is

necessary

.

–

Omitting to inform that

a

good is designed to limit its functionality when using consumables, spare parts or accessories that are not provided by the original producer

.

Article 2

–

Amendments to Directive 2011/83/EU

Article 2 of the proposal amends Directive 2011/83/EU as regards the pre-contractual information to be provided to consumers when concluding distance and off-premises contracts as well as contracts other than distance or off-premises contracts, in particular in regard to information on the durability and reparability of goods.

It also amends the Directive as regards the information of which consumers are to be made aware directly before placing their order, in the case of distance contracts to be concluded by electronic means.

As regards the pre-contractual information to be provided to consumers when concluding contracts other than distance or off-premises contracts, six additional items are added to the list under Article 5(1) of Directive 2011/83/EU, which comprises the information to be provided to the consumer in a clear and comprehensible manner.

These

six additional items

consist of:

–

information on the existence and length

,

of

a

producer’s commercial guarantee of

durability

for all

types of

goods, when this information is made available by the producer

;

–

information

that no information has been provided

by the producer

about the existe

nce

of a producer’s guarantee of durability for energy-using goods

;

–

the existence and length of the period during which the producer commits to providing software updates

for goods with digital elements

;

–

the existence and length of the period during which the provider commits to providing software updates for

digital content and digital services

;

–

the reparability score of the

good

as applicable under

Union

law

;

–

other repair information, should no reparability score be available

at

Union

level

–

such as information

on

the availability of spare parts

and a repair manual.

As regards the pre-contractual information to be provided to consumers when concluding distance and off-premises contracts, the same six items are added to the list under Article 6(1) of Directive 2011/83/EU (information to be provided to the consumer in a clear and comprehensible manner).

As regards the information consumers are to be made aware of directly before placing their order, in the case of distance contracts to be concluded by electronic means, information on the existence and length (or that no such information has been provided, in the case of energy-using goods) of a producer’s commercial guarantee of durability is added to the list of such information to be provided under Art 8(2) of Directive 2011/83/EU.

2022/0092 (COD)

Proposal for a

DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Directives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards empowering consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and better information

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the

European Economic and Social Committee

,

20

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)

In order to tackle unfair commercial practi

c

es

which prevent consumers from making sustainable consumption choices,

such as

practices

associated with

the early

obsolescence of goods, misleading environmental claims (“greenwashing”), non-transparent and non-credible sustainability labels or sustainability information tools

,

specific rules should be introduced in Union consumer law. This would enable

national

competent bodies

to address th

o

se practices effectively

.

By ensuring that environmental claims are fair, consumers will be able to choose products that are genuinely

better for

the environment

than

competing products

.

This will encourage competition towards more environmentally sustainable products, thus reducing negative impact on the environment.

(2)

Th

ose new rules

should be

introduced

both through amending Article

s

6

and 7

of Directive 2005/29/EC

of the

European

Parliament and of the Council

21

relating to those commercial practices which are to be considered misleading, and therefore prohibited, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, and through amending

Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC with the addition of specific misleading practices which are in all circumstances consi

dered unfair, hence prohibited.

(3)

I

n order to

deter

traders

from

deceiv

ing

consumers as regards the environmental

or social impact

,

durability

or reparability

of their product

s

,

including through the overall presentation of the product

s

,

A

rticle 6(1) of Directive 2005/29/EC

should be amended by

adding the environmental

or social

impact

,

durability and reparability

of the product

to

the list of

the main

characteristics

of the product

in respect of which the

trader

’s

practices

can be considered misleading

,

following a case-by-case assessment

.

Infor

mation

provided by traders on the social sustainability of products, such as

working conditions, charity contributions or animal welfare, should not mislead consumers

either.

(4)

E

nvironmental claims, in particular climate-related claims

,

increasingly

relate to

future performance in the form of a transition to carbon or climate neutrality, or

a

similar

objective

, by a certain date. Through such claims,

traders create

the impression that

consumers

contribute to

a low-carbon economy

by purchasing

their products.

T

o ensure the

fairness

and credibility

of such claims

, Article 6(2) of Directive 2005/29/EC

should be amended to

prohibit

such claim

s

,

following a case-by-case assessment

,

when they are not

supported

by

clear, objective and verifiable commitments

and targets

given by the trader

. Such claims should also be supported by

a

n independent

monitoring system

to monitor the

progress

of the trader with

regard to

the

commitments and targets

.

(5)

Another potentially

misleading

commercial practice which should be added to

the

specific practices targeted by

Article 6(2) of Directive 2005/29/EC

is

advertising benefits for consumers that are

actually

a common practice in the relevant market.

For example, if the absence of a chemical substance is a common practice in a specific product market,

its

promotion

as a distinctive

feature

of the product

could constitute

an

unfair commercial practice

.

(6)

Comparing products based on their environmental or social aspects, including through the use of

sustainability

information tools, is an increasingly common marketing technique. In order to ensure that

such

comparisons do not mislead consumers, Article 7 of Directive 2005/29/EC should be amended to require that the consumer is provided with

information about the method of the comparison, the products which are the object of comparison and the suppliers of those products, and the measures to keep information up to date. This should ensure that consumers make better informed transactional decisions when using such services. The comparison should be objective by, in particular, comparing

products which serve the same function, using a common method and common assumptions, and comparing material and verifiable features of the products being compared.

(7)

T

he displaying of

sustainability

labels which are not based on a certification scheme or not established by public authorities

sh

ould

be

prohibited

by including such practices

in the list in

Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC

.

The certification scheme should fulfil minimum transparency and credibility conditions

.

The displaying

of sustainability

labels remains possible without

a certification

scheme

where such

label

s

are

established by

a public authority

,

or in case of additional forms of expression and presentation of food in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011

.

This

rule

complements

point

4 of

Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC

which

prohibits

claiming that a trader, the commercial practices of a trader, or a product has been approved, endorsed or authorised by a public or private body when it has not, or making such a claim without complying with the terms of the approval, endorsement or authorisation.

(8)

In cases where the displaying of a sustainability label involves a commercial communication

that

suggests or creates the impression that a product has a positive or no impact on the environment, or is less damaging to the environment than competing products, that sustainability label also

should be considered as

constitut

ing

an environmental claim.

(9)

Annex I to

Directive 2005/

2

9/EC

should

also

be amended to prohibit

making

generic

environm

e

ntal

claims without recognised

excellent

environmental performance

which is relevant to the claim

.

Examples of such

generic

environmental claims are ‘environmentally friendly’, ‘eco-friendly’, ‘eco’, ‘green’, ‘nature’s friend’, ‘ecological’, ‘environmentally correct’, ‘climate friendly’, ‘gentle on the environment’, ‘carbon frie

ndly’, ‘carbon neutral’, ‘carbon positive’, ‘climate neutral’,

‘energy efficient’,

‘biodegradable’

,

‘bio

based’

or

similar statements, as well as broader statements such as ‘conscious’ or ‘responsible’ that suggest or create the impression of excellent

environmental

per

formance

. Such generic environmental claims should be prohibited

whenever

there is no excellent environmental performance demonstrated or whenever

the

specification of the

claim is not provided in clear and prominent terms on the same medium,

such as the same advertising spot, product’s packaging or online selling interface

.

For example, the claim ‘biodegradable’

,

referr

ing

to a product,

would be a generic claim,

whilst

claiming that ‘

t

he packaging is biodegradable throu

gh home composting in one month’

would be a specific claim,

which does not fall under this

prohibition

.

(10)

E

xcellent environmental performance can be demonstrated

by compliance

with

Regulation (EC)

No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council

22

,

or

officially recognised ecolabelling schemes in the Member States

,

or

compliance

with

top environmental performance

for a specific environmental aspect

in accordance with

other applicable Union laws

,

such as

a

class A in accordance with Regulation (EU)

2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council

23

.

The excellent environmental performance in question

should

be relevant to the claim. For example,

a generic claim ‘energy efficient’ could be

made

based on excellent environmental performance in accordance with Regulation (EU)

2017/1369.

By contrast

,

a generic claim ‘biodegradable’ could not be made based on

excellent environmental performance in accordance with

Regulation (EC)

No

66/2010

,

insofar as

there are no requirements for biodegradability

in the specific EU Ecolabel criteria related to the product in question.

(11)

Another misleading commercial practice which should be prohibited

in all circumstances

and thus added to

the list

in Annex I to

Directive 2005/

2

9/EC is

m

aking an environmental claim

about the entire product when it actually concerns only a certain aspect of the product

.

This

would be

the

case for example when

a

product

is marketed a

s

‘

made with

recycled material’

giving

the impression that

the entire

product

is made of recycled material

, when in fact

it is only the packaging

that is

made of

recycled

material

.

(12)

The Circular Economy Action Plan

24

provides for the need to set the rules on environmental claims using

Product and Organisation Environmental Footprint methods. Additional requirements on environmental claims will

have to

be set in specific Union legislation. Th

o

se new requirements will contribute to the Green Deal

25

objective of enabling buyers to make more sustainable decisions and reduce the risk of greenwashing through reliable, comparable and verifiable information.

(13)

Presenting

requirements imposed by law on all products within the relevant product category on the Union market, including imported products,

as a distinctive feature of the trader’s offer,

sh

ould

also

be

prohibited

in all circumstances

and added to the list

in

Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC

.

This

prohibition

could

apply

,

for example,

when

a trader

i

s advertising that a

given

product does not include a specific chemical substance while th

at

substance is already forbidden

by law

for all products within that product category in the U

nion

. Conversely, the prohibition should not

cover commercial practices promoting traders

’

or products

’

compliance with

legal requirements that only apply to some products but not to other competing products of the same category

on the U

nion

market

, such as products of non-EU origin

.

(14)

In order to improve

the

welfare

of consumers

, t

he amendment

s

to Annex I

to

Directive 2005/29/EC

should

also

address several practices associated with

early

obsolescence

,

including planned obsolescence practices

, understood

as

a commercial policy involving deliberately planning or designing a product with a limited useful life so that it

prematurely

become

s

obsolete or non-functional after a certain period of time

.

P

urchasing products

that

are

expect

ed

to

last longer than they actually do

causes

consumer detriment

. Furthermore,

early obsolescence practices have an

overall negative impact on the environment

in

the

form of

increased

material waste

.

Therefore, addressing those practices

are also likely to

reduce

the amount of waste, contributing to a more sustainable consumption.

(15)

I

t should be prohibited to omit to

inform the

consumer that a

software

update, including

a security update, will

negatively impact the use of goods with digital elements

or certain features of th

ose

good

s

, even if the update

improves the

function

ing

of other features

.

For example, when

inviting

consumer

s

to update the operating system on their smartphone, the trader will have to inform the consumer if such an update will negatively impact the functioning of any of the features of the smartphone.

(16)

It

should also

be

prohibit

ed

to

o

mit to inform the consumer about the existence of a feature of the good

introduced to

limit its durability

.

For e

xample, such

a

feature

could be

software which

stops or downgrades the functionality of the good after

a particular period of time, or it could be a piece of hardware which is

designed

to fail after a particular period of time.

The prohibition of omitting to inform consumers of such features

of the goods

complements

and

does not affect

the

remedies available to

consumer

s

when they constitute a lack of conformity under

Directive (EU) 2019/771 of the European Parliament and of the Council

26

. For

such

a commercial practice to be considered unfair

, i

t should not be necessary to demonstrate that the purpose of the feature is to stimulate the replacement of the respective good.

The

use of features limiting the durability of the goods should be distinguished from

manufacturing practices using materials or processes of

general

low quality resulting in limited durability

of the goods

.

L

ack of conformity of a good result

ing

from the use of low quality materials or processes

should

continue to be governed by the rules on the conformity of goods set out in Directive (EU) 2019/771.

(17)

Another practice which should be prohibited under Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC is the practice of c

laiming that a good has a certain durability when it does not.

That would be the case, for instance,

when a trader informs

consumer

s

that a washing machine

is

expected to last a

certain

number of washing cycles

, while the actual use of washing machine

shows this is not

the case

.

(18)

Similarly,

Annex I

to

Directive 2005/29/EC should also be amended to prohibit

p

resenting products as allowing repair when

such repair is not possible

,

as well as omitting to inform consumers that

it is not possible to repair

goods

in accordance with legal requirements.

(19)

The prohibition of

th

o

se

practices in relation to durability and reparability in Directive 2005/29/EC

w

ould

provide the consumer protection authorities

of Member States

with an additional enforcement

tool

for better protection of consumers’ interests in the cases where traders fail to comply with requirements on the durability and reparability of goods under U

nion

product legislation.

(20)

Another practice associated with early obsolescence which should be prohibited

and

added

to

the list

in

Annex I

to

Directive 2005/29/EC is

i

nducing the consumer into replacing the consumables of a product earlier than

would otherwise be

necessary

for technical

reasons

.

Such

practice

s

mislead the consumer into believing that

the

good

s

will no longer function unless the

ir

consumables are replaced

, thus leading them to purchase more consumables than necessary

.

For example,

the practice of

urg

ing

the consumer

, via the settings of the printer,

to replace the

printer

ink cartridge

s

before they are actually

empty

in order

to

stimulate the purchase of additional ink cartridges

would be prohibited.

(21)

Annex I

to Directive 2005/29/EC should also be amended to prohibit o

mitting to inform

the consumer

that

the good is designed to limit its functionality when using consumables

, spare parts

or

accessories

that are not provided by the original producer.

For example,

the marketing of

printer

s

that are designed to limit

their

functionality

when using

ink cartridges

not

provided by

the

original producer

of the printer

without disclosing this information to the consumer would be prohibited. Th

is

practice could mislead consumers into purchasing an alternative ink cartridge

which cannot be used for that printer, thus leading to unnecessary

repair costs

,

waste streams

or

additional costs

due to the obligation to use the original producer’s consumables

which the consumer could not foresee at the time of purchase.

Similarly,

marketing

smart devices

designed to limit

their

functionality when using chargers

or spare parts

that are not provided by the original producer

without disclosing this information to the consumer would be prohibited

as well

.

(22)

In order for consumers to take

better

informed decisions and stimulate the demand for, and the supply of, more durable goods,

specific

information about a product’s durability and reparability should be provided

for all type

s

of goods

before concluding the contract

.

Moreover, as regards

goods with digital elements, digital content and digital services, consumers should

be

inform

ed about the

period of time during which

free

software updates are available

. Therefore, Directive 2011/83/EU

of the European Parliament and of the Council

27

should be amended to provide consumers with pre-contractual information about durability, reparability

and

the availability of updates

.

Information should be provided to consumers in a clear and comprehensible manner and in line with the accessibility requirements

of Directive 2019/882

28

.

The

obligation to

provide this

inform

ation to

consumers complements and

does not affect

the rights

of consumers

provided in

Directive

s

(EU) 2019/

770

29

and

(EU) 2019/771

30

of the European Parliament and of the Council

.

(23)

A

good

indicator

of a good’s durability

is

the

producer’s

commercial guarantee of durability within the meaning of

Article 17 of

Directive (EU) 2019/771. Therefore,

Directive 2011/83/EU should be amended to specifically require

traders selling goods

to

inform consumers about the existence of the

producer’s

commercial guarantee

of durability

for all type

s

of goods

, where the producer makes this information available

.

(24)

The problem of limited durability contrary to consumer expectations is most relevant for energy-using goods

, which

are

goods that function from an external energy source. Consumers are also most interested in receiving information about the

expected

durability of

this

category of goods. For

th

ese

reason

s

,

only for this category of goods, consumers should be made aware that the information about the existence of

a

producer’s

commercial

guarantee of durability

of more than two years

has not been provided by the producer

.

(25)

Goods containing energy-using components, where those components are mere accessories and do not contribute to the main function of th

ose

goods, such as decorative lighting for clothing or footwear or electric light for a bicycle,

should

not be classified as energy-using goods.

(26)

I

n view of the established minimum duration of two years of the seller’s liability for lack of conformity in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/771 and the fact that many product

failures

occur after two years, the trader’s obligation to inform consumers about the existence and

duratio

n

of

the

producer’s

commercial guarantee of durability should apply to guarantees that are of more than two years

.

(27)

In order to make it easier for consumers to take an informed

transactional

decision when comparing goods before concluding a contract, traders should inform consumers about

the existence and

duration

, of the

producer’s

commercial guarantee of durability for the entire good and not for specific components of the good.

(28)

T

he producer and the seller

should

remain free to offer

other types of

commercial guarantees

and after-sales services

of any

duration

. However, the information provided to the consumer about such

other

commercial guarantees or services

should not confuse the consumer with regard to the existence and

duration

of the

producer’s

commercial guarantee

of durabilit

y

that covers the entire good and has a duration of more than two years

.

(29)

To promote competition between producers as regards the durability of

goods with digital elements

the traders selling those goods

should inform consumers about

the

minimum

period of

time

during which the producer

commits to

provide

software

updates for such goods. However, to avoid overloading consumers with information, such information

should only

be

provided when this

period

is longer than

the

period of

the

producer’s

commercial guarantee of durability

, as th

at

guarantee entails the provision of updates, including security

updates

,

that

are necessary to maintain the required functions and performance of goods with digital elements.

Furthermore, information

about the producer’s commitment to provide software updates

is relevant only where the sales contract regarding goods with digital elements provides for a single act of supply of the digital content or digital service in respect of which Article 7(3

)

, point

(

a

)

,

of

Directive (EU) 2019/771

applies

.

In contrast,

th

ere should be no

new

obligation to provide that

information

w

here the sales contract provides for a continuous supply of the digital content or digital service over a period of time

,

since

for

th

o

se

contracts

Article 7(3), point (b),

of Directive (EU) 2019/771

specif

ies

, by reference to Article

10

(2) or (5),

the period of time during which

the seller

is to

ensure that the consumer is informed of and supplied with updates

.

(30)

Likewise, t

raders offering digital content and digital services

should

also

inform consumers about

the

minimum

period

during which the provider

of the digital content or digital service

,

where

the provider

is different from the trader, commits to

provide

software

updat

es, including security updates,

necessary to keep the digital content and digital services in conformity.

Information about the provider’s commitment to provide software updates is relevant only where the contract provides for a single act of supply or a series of individual acts of

supply in respect of which Article 8(2)

, point

(b)

,

of

Directive 2019/770

applies

.

In contrast

, t

here should be no

new

obligation to provide that

information w

here the contract provides for a continuous supply over a period of time

,

since

for these contracts

Article 8(2), point (a) of Directive (EU) 2019/770 specifies the period of time

during which the

trader

is

to

ensure that the consumer is informed of and supplied with updates.

(31)

To allow consumers to make an informed

transactional

decision and choose goods that are easier to repair, traders should provide

,

before the conclusion of the contract,

for all

types of goods

, where applicable,

the reparability score of the good as provided by the produce

r in accordance with Union law.

(32)

Pursuant

to Article 5

(1)

, point

(e)

,

and Article 6

(1)

, point

(m)

,

of Directive 2011/83/EU traders are obliged to provide the consumer before the consumer is bound by the contract with information on the existence and the conditions of after-sales services, including repair services

,

where

such services are provided. In

addition, i

n order to ensure that consumers are well informed about the reparability of the goods they purchase, where a reparability score is not established

in accordance with Union law

, traders should provide,

for all

types of

goods

,

other relevant repair information

that is

made available by the producer, such as information

about

the availability of spare parts, and a user and repair manual.

(33)

T

raders

should

provide consumers with information about the existence and duration of the

producer’s

commercial guarantee of durability, the

minimum period for updates and the repair information other than the reparability score, where the producer

or provider of the digital content or digital service

,

when different from the trader,

makes the relevant information available.

In particular, as regards goods,

t

he

trader should convey to consumers the information that the producer has provided to the trader or has otherwise intended to make readily available to the consumer before the conclusion of the contract, by indicating it on the product itself, its packaging or tags and labels that the consumer would

normally

consult

before concluding the contract

. The trader should not be required to actively search for such information from the producer, for example, on the product-specific websites.

(34)

D

irectives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU

should

continue to

work as a ‘safety net’ ensuring that a high level of consumer

protection

can be maintained in all sectors, by complementing sector

and product

-specific Union law that

prevail in case of conflict

.

(35)

Since the objectives of this

Directive

, namely

,

enabling

better

informed

transactional

decisions by consumers to

promote

sustainable consumption, eliminating practices that cause damage to the sustainable economy and mislead consumers away from sustainable consumption choices, and ensuring a better and

consistent

application of the

Union

consumer legal framework,

cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States individually but can rather, by reason of the Union-wide character of the problem, be better achieved at

U

nion

level, the

U

nion

may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary

to

achieve those objectives.

(36)

In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents

31

, Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified
