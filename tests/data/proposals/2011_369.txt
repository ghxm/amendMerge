Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing for the period 2014 to 2020 the Justice Programme /* COM/2011/0759 final - 2011/0369 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

As confirmed bythe Stockholm Programme, the development of an area of freedom, security andjustice remains a priority for the European Union. Although significantprogress has already been achieved in this field, judicial cooperation in civiland criminal matters is still insufficient. In the post-Lisbon era and afterthe abolition of the third pillar the area of justice develops dynamically inorder to respond to all challenges. Legislative and policy measures as well astheir coherent implementation are key tools. Funding can contribute to thedevelopment of this area through supporting legislation and policy-making andpromoting their implementation.

In accordance with the Communication on theEU Budget Review[1],a fresh look was taken at the existing funding instruments and deliverymechanisms to ensure clear focus on European added value and to cater forrationalisation and simplification of the funding mechanisms. In ‘A Budget forEurope 2020’[2],the Commission identified the need for a simpler and more transparent budget toovercome the problems that arise from the complexity of programme structuresand the existence of multiple programmes. The area of justice was mentioned asan example of the existing fragmentation, where action should be taken.

Within this framework and aiming atsimplification and rationalisation, the Justice programme is the successor ofthree current programmes:

- Civil Justice (JCIV),

- Criminal Justice (JPEN),

- Drug Prevention and Information Programme(DPIP).

Whereas DPIP was based on a public healthlegal basis and therefore covered health considerations, notably the reductionof health harms associated with drug use, the Justice programme approachesanti-drugs policy via the angle of crime prevention. Illicit drug trafficking,which is one of the areas of crime where the European legislator may adoptminimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions onthe basis of Article 83 TFEU, and other illegal activities related to drugswill be the main focus of drug-related funding under the new programme.

The merge of these programmes, all based onprovisions in Part III, Title V of the TFEU, will allow for a comprehensivefunding approach in this area and for a more efficient allocation of funds forhorizontal issues, such as training.

The general objective of this proposal isto contribute to the creation of a genuine area of justice through promotingjudicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. To achieve this generalobjective, the proposal aims to promote effective, comprehensive and consistentapplication of Union legislation in the areas of judicial cooperation in civiland criminal matters, to fostering access to justice and to prevent and reduce drugdemand and supply.

This can beachieved by supporting training and awareness-raising, strengthening networksand facilitating transnational cooperation. Moreover, the European Union needsto equip itself with a sound analytical basis to support policy-making andlegislation in the area of justice.

2.           RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THEINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

2.1.        Consultation with theinterested parties

A public stakeholder consultation on futurefunding activities in the area of Justice, Fundamental Rights and Equality forthe period after 2013[3]was launched on 20 April 2011. It was available online for two months and wasopen to all interested stakeholders and individuals. 187 respondents – with animportant part of NGOs - from most Member States submitted their contribution.

The respondents evaluated positively thepolicy objectives of the programmes and confirmed the need for funding in theareas covered. The European added value was acknowledged and no area wasidentified where funding should be discontinued. The need for simplificationand improvement was acknowledged and most of the proposed measures received apositive response, including the reduction of the number of programmes and thesimplification of procedures.

The stakeholders were in favour of fundingactivities such as exchange of good practices, training of professionals,information and awareness raising activities, support to networks, studies,etc. All types of activities which met with approval by the respondents areforeseen explicitly in Article 6 of the proposal. The respondents were inagreement with the Commission's proposals concerning the actors appropriate toreceive funding and the types of funding mechanisms that could be used.

2.2.        Impact Assessment

One impact assessment was carried outconcerning the future funding activities for the whole area of justice, rightsand equality, which currently comprises six programmes[4]. This impact assessment isrelevant for both the proposal on the Justice Programme, as well as theproposal on the Rights and Citizenship Programme. The impact assessment buildson the interim evaluations of the current programmes[5], which confirmed the overalleffectiveness and efficiency of the programmes, but they also identified someshortcomings and room for improvement. The impact assessment has consideredthree options:

Option A: to maintain six programmes and toaddress some of the identified problems through changes in the internalmanagement of the programmes. Improving management and fostering strongsynergies between the programmes would address some of the issues. However, themain cause of the problems, i.e. the multitude of programmes would not bedirectly addressed and consequently the improvements to be achieved by this optionwould be limited.

Option B: tomaintain all measures of option A and additionally to merge the current six programmes into two programmes. This option wouldallow for flexibility in the use of funds and in addressing annual policypriorities. It would achieve increased simplification (both for thebeneficiaries and the administration) and efficiency of the programmes, sincesignificantly fewer procedures would be needed. The effectiveness of theprogrammes would also be improved as the fragmentation and dilution of fundswould be addressed better within two programmes. Human resources could befreed, since fewer procedures would reduce the administrative burden and theywould be allocated to activities improving the effectiveness of the programmes(dissemination of results, monitoring, providing information, etc).

Option C: to implement only one programme. This option addresses all problemscaused by the multiple legal instruments and by the increased administrativeburden of managing multiple programmes. However, due to legal constraints thescope of this programme would not be able to cover the funding needs of allpolicy areas. A choice would have to be made between the area of justice andthe area of rights and citizenship. Although this solution can deliver maximumimpact in terms of management, however it would not be possible to addresssufficiently the policy priorities and needs of the whole policy area.

Resulting from the analysis and comparisonof the options, the preferred option is the implementation of twoprogrammes which would cover the funding needs of all policy areas (optionB). In comparison to the status quo option B presents clear advantages andno disadvantage. Option A is not as beneficial as option B and option C onlyoffers partial coverage of the policy areas, which renders this optionunsuitable.

3.           LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL

The proposal is based on Article 81 (1) and(2), Article 82 (1) and Article 84 of the Treaty on the Functioning of theEuropean Union.

The combination of Articles 81 and 82allows for a comprehensive approach in supporting the development of judicialcooperation in civil and criminal matters, especially in terms of cross-cuttingand horizontal issues affecting both justice areas.

Article 84 foresees the establishment ofmeasures to promote and support the action of Member States in the field ofcrime prevention. The Programme does not intend to cover the whole area ofcrime prevention, but only the area of anti-drugs policy. It aims to adopt acomprehensive approach to fighting drug demand and supply, covering funding tosupport Member States’ cross-border cooperation on enforcement.

The funding activities proposed respect theprinciples of European added value and of subsidiarity. Funding from the Unionbudget concentrates on activities whose objectives cannot be sufficientlyachieved by the Member States alone, where the Union intervention can bringadditional value compared to action of Member States alone. Activities coveredby this Regulation contribute to the effective application of the acquis bydeveloping mutual trust between Member States, increasing cross-bordercooperation and networking and achieving correct, coherent and consistentapplication of Union law across the Union. The European Union is in a betterposition than Member States to address cross-border situations and to provide aEuropean platform for mutual learning. A sound analytical basis for the supportand the development of policies will be supported. European Union interventionallows for these activities to be pursued consistently across the Union andbrings economies of scale.

The proposal complies with the proportionality principle in that itdoes not go beyond the minimum required in order to achieve the statedobjective at European level and what is necessary for that purpose.

4.           BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

The financial envelope for theimplementation of the Justice Programme for the period 1 January 2014 to 31December 2020 shall amount to EUR 472 million (current prices).

5.           MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL

The aim of theproposed approach is to combine the simplification of funding procedures, asrequested by all involved parties, with a more result-oriented approach. Themain elements of this approach are the following:

- The proposaldefines the general and specific objectives pursued by the Programme (Articles4 and 5) and the areas of action where the Programme will focus on (Article 6).The general and specific objectives define the scope of the programme (policyareas), whereas the types of actions are funding-oriented, they are applicableto all policy areas concerned and define in a horizontal way the outputs thatcan be achieved by funding. At the same time, they define where funding can reallybe of added value for the achievement of the policy objectives. In implementingthis Regulation the Commission will establish annually the funding prioritiesin the respective policy areas. The Programme can make use of all financialinstruments foreseen in the Financial Regulation. The participation is open toall legal entities legally established in the Member States or in a thirdcountry participating in the Programme, with no further limitations to theaccess to the programme. This structure allows forsimplification, as well as for better orientation of the programme to thepolicy needs and developments. Moreover, it provides a stable context forevaluation, as the specific objectives are directly linked to indicators forevaluation, which will remain consistent for the whole duration of theprogramme and will be monitored and evaluated regularly. It is proposed not to reserve specific amounts per policy areawithin the programme in order to achieve flexibility and to improve theimplementation of the programme.

- Theparticipation of third countries is limited to EEA, accession and candidatecountries and potential candidates. Other thirdcountries, notably countries where the European Neighbourhood Policy applies,may be associated to actions of the Programme, if this serves the purpose ofthese actions.

- The annualpriorities of the programme will be defined in an annual work programme.Because this implies policy-driven choices, the adoption of the annual workprogramme is subject to the opinion of a Committee of Member States under theAdvisory procedure.

- The Commissionmay use, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, an existing executive agencyfor the implementation of the programme, as provided for in Council Regulation(EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executiveagencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Communityprogrammes.

The notionof ‘judiciary and judicial staff'

Judicialtraining of the judiciary and judicial staff is a key element of Justicepolicies. Judicial training enhances mutual confidence between Member States,practitioners and citizens and the Commission’sCommunication on European judicial training, "Buildingtrust in EU-wide justice, a new dimension to European judicial training", sets concrete training objectives to be achieved by 2020[6]. Articles 81(2)(h) and 82(1)(c) TFEUexplicitly target "Judiciary and Judicial staff". In accordance withthe Commission's Communication lawyers, while constituting an autonomousprofession, are an integral and necessary part of judicial activity and theyplay a central role in the implementation of Union law. As for notaries inseveral Member States they have important competence in the judicial field,which also leads them to contribute to the implementation of Union law. Takinginto account the spirit and the aims of the Treaty's provisions theseprovisions are extended to include these two professions.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

establishing for the period 2014 to 2020the Justice Programme

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(1) and (2), Article82(1) and Article 84 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)              The Treaty on the Functioning of the EuropeanUnion provides for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, inwhich persons are free to move. To that end, the Union may adopt measures todevelop judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters and promote andsupport the action of Member States in the field of crime prevention, notablyfor the prevention and reduction of drug demand and supply.

(2)              The Stockholm Programme[7] reaffirms the priority ofdeveloping an area of freedom, security and justice and specifies within itspolitical priorities the achievement of a Europe of law and justice. Financingis identified as one of the important tools for the successful implementationof the Stockholm Programme's political priorities.

(3)              The Communication from the Commission on Europe2020[8] sets out a strategy for smart,sustainable and inclusive growth. A well-functioning area of justice, whereobstacles in cross-border judicial proceedings and access to justice incross-border situations are eliminated, should be developed as a key element tosupport and promote the specific objectives and flagship initiatives of theEurope 2020 Strategy.

(4)              Experience of action at Union level has shownthat achieving these objectives in practice calls for a combination ofinstruments, including legislation, policy initiatives and funding. Funding is an important tool complementing legislative measures. A funding programme should therefore be established.

(5)              The Commission Communication on ‘A budget forEurope 2020’[9]stresses the need for rationalisation and simplification of Union funding.Meaningful simplification and efficient management of funding can be achievedthrough the reduction in the number of programmes and rationalisation,simplification and harmonisation of funding rules and procedures.

(6)              In response to the need for simplification andefficient management of funding, this Regulation establishes the JusticeProgramme to provide for the continuation and development of activities previouslycarried out on the basis of three programmes, established by Decision No 1149/2007/EC of the European Parliamentand of the Council of 25 September 2007 establishingfor the period 2007-2013 the Specific Programme 'Civil Justice' as part of theGeneral Programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice'[10],Council Decision 2007/126/JHA of 12 February 2007establishing for the period 2007-2013, as part of the General Programme onFundamental Rights and Justice, the Specific Programme 'Criminal Justice'[11] and Decision No 1150/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of theCouncil of 25 September 2007establishing for the period 2007-2013 the Specific Programme 'Drug preventionand information' as part of the General Programme 'Fundamental Rights andJustice'.[12]

(7)              Whereas the Drugprevention and information programme was based on apublic health legal basis and therefore covered health considerations, notablythe reduction of health harms associated with drug use, the Justice programme shouldapproach anti-drugs policy via the angle of crime prevention. Illicit drugtrafficking and other illegal activities related to drugs should be the mainfocus of drug-related funding under the new programme.

(8)              The Commission Communications ‘The EU BudgetReview’[13]and ‘A budget for Europe 2020’ also underline the importance of focusingfunding on activities with clear European added value, i.e. where the Unionintervention can bring additional value compared to action of Member Statesalone. Actions covered by this Regulation should contribute to the creation ofa European area of justice by promoting the principle of mutual recognition,developing mutual trust between the Member States, increasing cross-bordercooperation and networking and achieving correct, coherent and consistentapplication of Union law. Funding activities should also contribute toachieving effective and better knowledge of Union law and policies by all thoseconcerned, and provide a sound analytical basis for the support and thedevelopment of Union legislation and policies. Union intervention allows for thoseactions to be pursued consistently across the Union and brings economies ofscale. Moreover the Union is in a better position than Member States to addresscross-border situations and to provide a European platform for mutual learning.

(9)              In the field of drugs, demand and supply createa real threat that Member States cannot tackle sustainably on their own. Unionintervention under this Regulation should support Member States' actions toprevent and reduce drug demand and supply, notably by supporting cross-bordercooperation on enforcement.

(10)          In order to implement the principle of soundfinancial management, this Regulation should provide for appropriate tools toassess its performance. To that end, it should define general and specificobjectives. To measure the achievement of those specific objectives, a set ofindicators should be established which should remain valid for the wholeduration of the Programme.

(11)          This Regulation lays down for the multiannualprogramme a financial envelope which is to constitute the prime reference,within the meaning of point 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of XXbetween the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperationin budgetary matters and on sound financial management, for the budgetaryauthority during the annual budgetary procedure.

(12)          This Regulation should be implemented in fullcompliance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No XX/XX of XX on the financial rules applicableto the annual budget of the European Union. In particular, it should make useof the simplification tools introduced by the latter. Moreover, the criteriafor identifying actions to be supported should aim at allocating the financialresources available on actions generating the highest impact in relation to thepolicy objective pursued.

(13)          Implementing powers should be conferred on theCommission in respect of the adoption of annual work programmes. Those powers shouldbe exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down therules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member Statesof the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers[14]. Given the annual amountsconcerned, the budgetary implications can be considered as non-substantial.Therefore, the advisory procedure should apply.

(14)          In order to ensure efficient allocation of fundsfrom the Union budget, consistency, complementarity and synergies should besought between funding programmes supporting policyareas with close links to each other, in particular between the Programme andthe Rights and Citizenship programme established by Regulation (EU) No XX/XX ofXX[15], the Instrumentfor financial support for police cooperation, crime prevention and the fightagainst cross-border, serious and organised crime establishedby Regulation (EU) No XX/XX of XX[16], the Health for Growth Programme establishedby Regulation (EU) No XX/XX of XX[17], the Erasmus for all Programme establishedby Regulation (EU) No XX/XX of XX,[18] the Horizon 2020 FrameworkProgramme established by Regulation (EU) No XX/XX of XX[19] andthe Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance establishedby Regulation (EU) No XX/XX of XX[20].

(15)          Pursuant to Articles 8 and 10 of the Treaty onthe Functioning of the European Union, the Programme should support the mainstreamingof equality between women and men and anti-discrimination objectives in all itsactivities. Regular monitoring and evaluation should be carried out to assessthe way in which gender equality and anti-discrimination issues are addressed inthe Programme's activities.

(16)          The financial interests of the Union should beprotected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle,including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, therecovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, whereappropriate, penalties. TheEuropean Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) should be authorised to carry out on-the-spotchecks and inspections on economic operators, in accordance with the procedureslaid down in Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96[21] with a view to establishingwhether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activityaffecting the financial interests of the Union in connection with Union fundingunder the Programme.

(17)          Since the objective of this Regulation, namely tocontribute to the creation of a European area of justice, cannot besufficiently achieved by the Member States and can be better achieved at Unionlevel, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle ofsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. Inaccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve thatobjective.

(18)          [In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol(No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of theArea of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Unionand to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, those Member Stateshave notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation]OR [Without prejudice to Article 4 of the Protocol (No 21) on the position ofthe United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security andJustice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Ireland will not takepart in the adoption of this Regulation and will not be bound by it or besubject to its application].[22]

(19)          In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of theProtocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on EuropeanUnion and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark isnot taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it orsubject to its application,

Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of theCouncil establishing for the period 2014 to 2020 the Justice Programme

1.2.                Policy area(s) concerned in the ABM/ABBstructure[23]

Title 33 - Justice

1.3.                Nature of the proposal/initiative

þ Theproposal/initiative relates to a new action

¨ Theproposal/initiative relates to a new action following a pilotproject/preparatory action[24]

¨ Theproposal/initiative relates to the extension of an existing action

¨ Theproposal/initiative relates to an action redirected towards a new action

1.4.                Objectives1.4.1.          The Commission's multiannual strategicobjective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative

The Programme aims to contribute to the creation of a European areaof freedom, security and justice, and in particular of a European area ofjustice, by promoting judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. Awell-functioning area of justice, where obstacles in cross-border judicialproceedings are eliminated, will also support and promote the specificobjectives and flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy.

1.4.2.          Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies)concerned

Specific objectives

To achieve the general objective of contributing to the creation ofa European area of justice, the Programme has the following specific objectives:

(a)      to promote effective, comprehensive and consistent applicationof Union legislation in the areas of judicial cooperation in civil and criminalmatters;

(b)     to facilitate access to justice;

(c)      to prevent and reduce drug demand and supply.

ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned

ABB 33 03 and 33 04.

1.4.3.          Expected result(s) and impact

Specify the effectswhich the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.

The proposal will contribute to the enforcement of the acquis,allowing citizens and businesses in the Union to fully benefit from theexisting legislation. They will be better aware of their rights, and MemberStates and stakeholders will have better tools to exchange information on bestpractices and to cooperate with each other. The effects of the proposal onbeneficiairies/target groups is described in more detail in Section 4.1.2 ofthe Impact Assessment.

In addition, the changes to the funding programmes proposed willhave a clear beneficial effect on the processes under which financial supportwill be managed. This would start from an integrated approach across theprogrammes in the applications processes, the documentation required and theIT-systems to be used. This in itself will constitute a concrete time-saving asmany stakeholders which are active in fields covered by several of the currentgenerations of programmes, would no longer have to address divergingrequirements and could concentrate more on developing strong proposals from acontent and quality point of view.

Furthermore, with a harmonised and streamlined single projectselection process, the delays between submitting applications and receiving theresults would be substantially reduced and this would leave applicantorganisation with a shorter interval of uncertainty. This would bring thefurther added advantage of projects starting much shorter after theirconception and therefore would respond much more effectively to the concreteneeds they seek to address in line with Union policy priorities

1.4.4.          Indicators of results and impact

Specify theindicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.

The indicators to measure the achievement of the above-mentionedspecific objectives, shall be, inter alia, the number of cases oftrans-border cooperation for (a) and (c) and the European perception of accessto justice for (b).

DG Justice does not have enough information about the currentsituation to establish meaningful long- or medium-term targets, but beforeimplementation of the programme starts, DG Justice will try to collect moreinformation on the current situation so that milestones and targets can be set.

1.5.                Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1.          Requirement(s) to be met in the short or longterm

Whereas legislation is a key tool to implement the Union’s objectivesin the area of Justice, it needs to be complemented by other means. In thiscontext, funding has an important role to play. In particular, funding shouldenhance the effectiveness of legislation by increasing knowledge, awareness andcapacity of citizens, professionals and stakeholders, through supporting:

Information and public awareness raising, including support fornational and European campaigns to inform people of their rights, as guaranteedunder Union law, and how to enforce them in practice;

Training and capacity building for legal professionals (such asjudges and prosecutors) and other practitioners, to equip them with the toolsto effectively put Union rights and policies into practice.

Funding also has a central role in promoting cooperation attransnational level and developing mutual trust, through:

Strengthening networks, i.e. Union-wide organisations to assist withthe preparation of future initiatives in this area, as well as to promote theirconsistent implementation across Europe;

Cross-border cooperation on enforcement, for example establishingmissing child alert systems, coordination of operational and cross-borderanti-drug cooperation.

Additionally, funding should support:

Research, analysis and other support activities, to provide to thelegislator clear and detailed information on the problems and the situation onthe ground. The results of these activities feed into the development and theimplementation of Union policies and ensure that they are evidence-based, welltargeted and well structured.

1.5.2.          Added value of EU involvement

Funding covered by the Justice Programme concentrates on activitieswhere the Union’s intervention can bring additional value compared to action ofMember States alone. Activities covered by this Regulation contribute to theeffective application of the acquis by developing mutual trust between MemberStates, increasing cross-border cooperation and networking and achievingcorrect, coherent and consistent application of Union law across the Union.Only action at Union level can provide coordinated activities that can reachall Union Member States. The European Union is in a better position than MemberStates to address cross-border situations and to provide a European platformfor mutual learning. Without Union support, stakeholders would tend to addresssimilar problems in a fragmented and disconnected way. Collaboration andnetworking between them will lead to the dissemination of best practices, inparticular innovative and integrated approaches in different Member States. Theparticipants in these activities will then act as multipliers in theirrespective professional activities and disseminate wider the best practiceswithin their Member State.

A sound analytical basis for the support and the development ofpolicies will be supported. European Union intervention allows for theseactivities to be pursued consistently across the Union and brings economies ofscale. Funding at national level would not provide the same results, but only afragmented and limited approach not covering the needs of the European Union asa whole.

1.5.3.          Lessons learned from similar experiences in thepast

The mid-term evaluations carried out for the current programmes inthe area of justice have confirmed the overall effectiveness of the programmes,but they have also identified a number of problems such as a dilution of funds('saupoudrage') amongst many small-scale projects with limited impact. Despitethe fact that funding is allocated to a multitude of projects, there is no balancedgeographical spread among the organisations which receive funding. The mid-termevaluations agree that more should be done to improve the dissemination andexploitation of results and outputs of the funded activities. Improvement indissemination goes hand in hand with improvement in the evaluation andmonitoring. The mid-term evaluations and the public consultation highlighted interms of efficiency the complex and bureaucratic procedures that the applicantsare facing. From an administrative point of view the multiplication ofprocedures for the different programmes imposes a high administrative burden onthe Commission. The multiplication of procedures and the high administrativeburden contribute to increasing the length of procedures. Merging the programmeswould address this issue and create synergies between the programmes.

1.5.4.          Coherence and possible synergy with otherrelevant instruments

The Programme will seek synergies, consistency and complementaritieswith other Union instruments, inter alia with the programmes in theareas of home affairs, health and consumers, education and research.Duplication with activities under these other programmes will be avoided, andresources may be shared between the Justice programmeand the Rights and Citizenship Programme to achievecommon objectives.

Comments

Thepossibility to use an existing executive agency for the full or partialimplementation of the Programme is provided for in the Explanatory Memorandum.At this stage, no decision has been taken in this regard, and no cost/benefitanalysis has been carried out, but the option should be kept open.

Jointmanagement is another option that is not used at the moment, but could beenvisaged in the future. This concerns in particular the internationalorganisations named in Article 7(2): Council of Europe, United Nations and theHague Conference on Private International Law.

2.                      MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1.                Monitoring and reporting rules

Specify frequencyand conditions.

The proposal includes monitoring and evaluation obligations.Achievement of the specific objectives will be monitored on the basis of theindicators contained in the proposal; on an annual basis.

Furthermore, an interim evaluation report on the achievement of theProgramme’s objectives, the efficiency of the use of resources and its Europeanadded value will be provided by the Commission by mid-2018 at the latest. An expost evaluation on the longer-term impacts and the sustainability of theeffects of the Programme will be provided after the end of the Programme.

2.2.                Management and control system 2.2.1.          Risk(s) identified

DG Justice has not been facing important risks of errors in itsspending programmes. This is confirmed by the recurrent absence of significantfindings in the annual reports of the Court of Auditors as well as by theabsence of residual error rate above 2% in the past years in DG Justice’s (andformer DG JLS) annual activity reports (with one single exception for theDaphne programme in 2009).

The main risks identified are the following:

- Risk of poor quality of selected projects and poor technicalimplementation of the project, reducing the programmes' impact; due toinadequate selection procedures, lack of expertise or insufficient monitoring;

- Risk of inefficient or non-economic use of funds awarded, both forgrants (complexity of reimbursing actual eligible costs coupled with limitedpossibilities to check eligible costs at the desk) and for procurement(sometimes limited number of economic providers with the required specialistknowledge entailing insufficient possibilities to compare price offers);

- Risk relating to the capacity of(especially) smaller organisations to effectively control expenditure as wellas to ensure the transparency of operations carried out;

- Reputational risk for the Commission, if fraud or criminalactivities are discovered; only partial assurance can be drawn from the thirdparties' internal control systems due to the rather large number of heterogeneouscontractors and beneficiaries, each operating their own control system, oftenrather small in size.

Most of these risks are expected to be reduced thanks to a bettertargeting of proposals and the use of simplified elements included in theTriennal revision of the Financial Regulation.

2.2.2.          Control method(s) envisaged

Description of internal control system

The control system envisaged for the future programme is acontinuation of the current control system. It is composed of differentbuilding blocks: supervision of operations by the Programme Management Unit,the ex-ante control (financial verification) by the central Budget and ControlUnit, the internal procurement committee (JPC), the ex-post controls for grantsand the audits from the Internal Audit Capacity and/or the Internal AuditService.

All transactions are subject to an ex ante verification by theProgramme Management Unit and a financial verification by the Budget andControl Unit (except for low-risk prefinancings). For grants, cost claims areverified thoroughly, and supporting documents are requested when deemednecessary, based on a risk assessment. All open and restricted procurementprocedures and all negotiated procedures above € 60.000 are submitted to theinternal procurement committee for checks before the award decision is adopted.

The ex-post control sector applies a"detection strategy" aimed at detecting a maximum of anomalies inview of recovering undue payments. Based on this strategy, the audits arecarried out on a sample of projects selected almost entirely on the basis of arisk analysis.

Costs and benefits of controls

We estimate that between 50 and 70% of all staff involved in themanagement of the current financial programmes performs control functions in abroad sense (from the selection of beneficiaries/contractors to theimplementation of audit results). This corresponds to a range between EUR 2,1million (50% of 2014 Human resource costs set out in Section 3.2.3) and EUR 3,2million (70% of 2020 Human resource costs set out in Section 3.2.3) Inaddition, externalisation of ex post audits produce costs in the range ofbetween € 75.000 and 100.000 per year, which are financed from administrativesupport appropriations. These costs represent between 6 and 3% of the totalbudget of the Programme, decreasing over the seven year period, due to the factthat the annual appropriations increase substantially between 2014 and 2020,whereas the costs of control remain quite stable.

Thanks to this combination of ex-ante and ex-post controls as wellas desk checks and on-site audits, in the past years the quantifiable averageresidual error rate was lower than 2%, with one exception for the Daphneprogramme in 2009, where the error rate rose slightly above 2%. This wasaddressed the year after via an increase of ex post controls on the spot. Thesecontrols have detected and corrected the remaining errors in this population.Therefore, the internal control system as well as its cost is deemed adequatein DG Justice to achieve the objective of a low error rate.

However, within this framework, DG Justice will continue to explorepossibilities to enhance the management and to increase simplification. Withthe reduction of the number of programmes, harmonised rules and procedures willapply, reducing the risk of error. In addition, the simplification tools madeavailable in the Triennal revision of the Financial Regulation will be used asmuch as possible as it is expected that they will contribute to the reductionof administrative burden for beneficiaries and thus represent a simultaneousreduction of risks of error and of administrative burden for the Commission.

2. Control with reference to corroborativeinformation incorporating an element of independent oversight (e.g. auditcertificate or other verification), but no reference to underlying documents.

3. Control with reference to fullyindependent corroborative information (e.g., database which justifies certainelements of the claim, 3rd party or Commission assessment ofmilestones achieved, etc.)

4. Control with reference to and includingaccess to the underlying documentation that is available at the stage of theprocess in question, for all inputs and outputs (e.g. timesheets, invoices,physical verification, etc.); i.e. control of the same intensity of transactiontesting as those carried out by the ECA as part of the DAS.

2.3.                Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities

Specify existing orenvisaged prevention and protection measures.

Different measures are or will be put in place for the futureJustice Programme to prevent fraud and irregularities. The proposal contains inits Article 12 a provision on the protection of the financial interests of theEuropean Union. In line with the Commission Anti-fraud strategy (CAFS), adoptedin June 2011, DG Justice is devising an anti-fraud strategy covering the wholeexpenditure cycle, having regard to the proportionality and cost-benefit of themeasures to be implemented. This strategy is based on two pillars: prevention,based on effective checks, and appropriate response, if fraud or irregularitiesare detected, consisting in the recovery of amounts wrongly paid and whereappropriate, by effective, proportionate and deterrent penalties. Theanti-fraud strategy describes the system of ex ante and ex post checks, basedon a system of red flags, and specifies the procedures to be followed by staffwhen fraud or irregularities are detected. It also provides information on theworking arrangements with OLAF.
