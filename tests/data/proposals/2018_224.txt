EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

•

Reasons and objectives

The ‘Horizon Europe’ proposal is fully in line with the Commission’s proposal on the next long-term Union budget for 2021 to 2027 as well as the Commission’s priorities as set out in its Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change and global policy priorities (the Sustainable Development Goals). It supports the agenda of the Union post-2020 as agreed in the Rome Declaration of 25 March 2017.

The proposal is framed by the premise that research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values, and enabling solutions that address challenges in a more systemic way.

The Horizon Europe package consists of proposals for:

1.

a Fra

mework Programme for Research and Innovation entitled

‘

Horizon Europe

’

, including laying down its rules for participation and dissemination (as per Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union –

‘

TFEU

’

),

2.

a specific programme to implement

‘

Horizon Eur

ope

’

(

‘

TFEU

’

),

3.

a Research and Training Programme under the Euratom Treaty complementing Horizon Europe, along with the

4.

associated impact assessment and legal financial statements.

A specific programme on defence research is proposed to be established by Regulation …/…/EU of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the European Defence Fund for the period 2021-2027.

The package merges two current legal acts (the Framework Programme and the Rules for Participation and Dissemination) into a single legal act and makes a number of improvements in terms of simplification along the way.

Specifically, Horizon Europe will strengthen the Union’s scientific and technological bases in order to help tackle the major global challenges of our time and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At the same time, the programme will boost the Union’s competitiveness, including that of its industries. Horizon Europe will help deliver on the Union’s strategic priorities and support the development and implementation of Union policies. In a swiftly changing world, Europe’s success increasingly depends on its ability to transform excellent scientific results into innovation that have a real beneficial impact on our economy and quality of life, and create new markets with more skilled jobs.

To achieve this aim and build on the success of its predecessor, Horizon Europe continues to support the whole R&I cycle in an integrated manner.

The principle of a single set of rules for participation and dissemination is maintained, while this proposal improves further on these rules.

This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2021 and is presented for a Union of 27 Member States, in line with the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and Euratom based on Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union received by the European Council on 29 March 2017.

•

Consistency with existing policy provisions

The Framework Programme is the Union’s flagship programme to support R&I from concept to market uptake. It aims to complement national and regional funding. The framework programme has already provided unique European added value in supporting continent-wide competition and collaboration for the very best science and innovation. This has resulted in scientific breakthroughs, increased competitiveness, and solutions to societal challenges. The new proposed framework programme, Horizon Europe, will aim to have an even greater impact than the current one, Horizon 2020 which is a widely acknowledged asset towards achieving Europe’s ambitions. The rapidly evolving nature of research and innovation in a context of global competition makes public support for R&I more essential than ever, in particular at Union level where its added value is undisputed. The proposal is fully in line with the Commission’s agenda for R&I, including the headline target of investing 3% of the Union’s GDP on research and development, as well as with the Communication “A renewed European agenda for Research and Innovation – Europe’s chance to shape its future“ (the European Commission’s contribution to the informal leaders’ meeting on 16-17 May 2018).

•

Consistency with other Union policies

The proposal is fully consistent with existing Union policies.

Horizon Europe was developed taking into account the current Commission’s priorities, the Budget for Results policy (which demands that Union spending programmes must – more than ever – deliver value for money), the implementation of the 2030 Agenda on sustainable development, the implementation of the Union Global Strategy and the Commission’s proposal on the next long-term Union budget.

In areas like health, digital technologies, industrial transformation, inclusive and democratic societies, natural resources, energy, mobility, environment, food, low-carbon economy, space and security, R&I is critical to the successful delivery on Union priorities: in particular jobs and growth, the Digital Single Market, the Energy Union and climate action. R&I is at the core of productivity and the competitiveness of an advanced economy like the Union’s.

R&I investment will be complementary and mutually reinforcing with that of other Union programmes. R&I results will be exploited in synergy with other Union programmes to foster their uptake at national and regional level, thereby maximising the European innovation potential. This will be complemented by effective R&I communication and outreach campaigns targeting the general public. Complementarity and synergy of R&I support and exploitation across the Union's long-term budget will be maximised through a strategic R&I planning process, which will be sufficiently flexible to allow the Commission and Union institutions to swiftly react to urgent needs and new priorities.

The proposal is also fully consistent with the approach taken under the European Semester process of economic policy co-ordination. Those links should be continued and reinforced, building on the relevant contributions already made under Horizon 2020 in support of structural reforms to improve the quality and efficiency of national research and innovation systems at three levels: firstly, through substantial investment in scientific and technological research and innovation; secondly, by making the business environment more innovation-friendly and less risk-averse; and thirdly, by ensuring that European citizens get supported through what will be a fast and, for some, turbulent transition driven by

innovation, digitisation and global megatrends such as artificial intelligence and the circular economy

.

The Programme's actions should be used to address market failures or sub-optimal investment situations, in a proportionate manner, without duplicating or crowding out private financing and have a clear European added value. This will ensure consistency between the actions of the programme and EU State aid rules, avoiding undue distortions of competition in the internal market.

2.

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

•

Legal basis

‘Horizon Europe’ is based on the TFEU Titles ‘Industry’ and ‘Research and technological development and space’ (Articles 173, 182, 183 and 188).

Due to its strong support to innovation, the Specific Programme implementing Horizon Europe is now based on the TFEU Titles ‘Industry’ and ‘Research and technological development and space’(Articles 173 and 182), as is the specific programme on defence research (

ibid

).

The European Institute for Innovation and Technology (EIT) derives from the ‘Industry’ title and will continue to be funded by a financial contribution from Horizon Europe.

The proposal for the Euratom research and training programme is based on Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty.

•

Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)

The Union has a shared (parallel) competence in this area based on Article 4(3) TFEU. In order to address the challenges Europe is currently facing, the Union needs to invest in R&I in order to reach economies of scale, scope and speed. Union-funded R&I activities produce demonstrable benefits compared to national and regional  R&I support: they create critical mass to address global challenges; strengthen the Union's scientific excellence through competitive funding; create cross-border, multidisciplinary networks; reinforce human capital; structure national R&I systems; increase the Union’s competitiveness; and create new market opportunities.

•

Proportionality

Actions at Union level will enable trans-national collaboration and world-wide competition to ensure the best proposals are selected. This raises levels of excellence and provides visibility for leading R&I, but also supports trans-national mobility and attracts the best talents. A Union-level programme is best placed to take on high-risk and long-term R&I, thereby sharing the risk and generating a breadth of scope and economies of scale that could not otherwise be achieved. Interlinkages with national initiatives will be sought, in particular in the area of innovation.

Similarly, it can leverage additional public and private investments in R&I; contribute to further strengthening the European R&I landscape; and accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation. Union-level programmes can also support policy-making and policy objectives.

The proposed actions do not go beyond what is required for Union objectives.

•

Choice of the instrument

As in the past, the legal act is in a form of a regulation since it creates rights for and obligations on beneficiaries, binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all Union Member States and countries associated to the Framework Programme.

3.

RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

•

Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation

Union Framework Programmes have generated significant and long-lasting impacts as has been shown by successive evaluations since the Union started investing in R&I in 1984.

This proposal is built on the feedback from stakeholders, findings of the interim evaluations of the current programmes, the ex-post evaluations of previous programmes, and foresight activities.

The Communication on the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020 identified several areas for improvement. In addition to an in-depth analysis, the findings of the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020 were based on extensive stakeholder feedback and the strategic recommendations of the independent High Level Group on maximising the impact of EU R&I Programmes (the ‘Lamy’ High Level Group). In a nutshell, these conclusions could be summarised as to:

(a)

continue simplification;

(b)

support breakthrough innovation;

(c)

create more impact by being focused around missions and by citizen involvement;

(d)

increase synergies with other Union funding programmes and Union policies;

(e)

strengthen international cooperation;

(f)

reinforce openness; and

(g)

rationalise the funding landscape.

•

Stakeholder consultations

Through open consultations, the Commission sought feedback on the key elements of the design of the post-2020 Union programme for R&I. The results of these consultations fed into the Impact Assessment for the programme and helped shape the drafting of the present legal proposal.

Consultations were run at different times to ensure systematic account of stakeholder views in the design and formulation of the Horizon Europe programme. To take account of different information needs, consultations ranged from stakeholder conferences and events, to expert groups, online consultations, workshops, meetings and seminars and analyses of position papers.

Fostering R&I in the Union emerged as the most important policy challenge by 97% of respondents to the cluster-based open public consultation on the Union’s next long-term budget in the areas of investment, R&I, SMEs and the single market.

Stakeholders’ key messages can be summarised as follows:

·

The three-pillar structure of Horizon 2020 should be kept, though better links between the pillars are needed;

·

Successful individual researchers

’

schemes (ERC, MSCA) need increased budgets;

·

Grants should

remain the main funding model, complemented with dedicated financial instruments, when appropriate;

·

Support should be provided to activities that help spread or share excellence;

·

Smaller-scale collaborative projects are important for widening participatio

n;

·

Missions have all the hallmarks of being an impactful way forward;

·

Citizens should be made more involved with the Framework Programme;

·

The European Innovation Council should be an European accelerator of innovation;

·

There is a need to boost internationa

l cooperation to tackle global challenges;

·

D

ata and knowledge produced from Union-funded projects should be accessible by all;

·

There is a marked need to make the R&I landscape simpler;

·

Synergies with other Union programmes are difficult to achieve but are

a must;

·

The programming process for the calls and missions needs to be enhanced;

·

The drive for simplification needs to continue; and

·

Being able to measure and communicate impact is key.

•

External expertise

The Commission has relied extensively on external expertise. This includes in particular the recommendations and findings of the High Level Group chaired by Pascal Lamy, presented in the report ‘

LAB – FAB – APP: Investing in the European future we want, Report of the independent High Level Group on maximising the impact of EU Research & Innovation Programmes

’, adopted in July 2017.

The

European Innovation Council High Level Group of Innovators

was set up in January 2017 and mandated to support the European Commission in developing the European Innovation Council. The report ‘

Europe is back: Accelerating breakthrough i

nnovation

’ with 14 recommendations was adopted in January 2018.

Following the recommendations of the Lamy report on missions, an external expert was appointed to advise the Commission on the mission-oriented approach. In February 2018, Professor Mariana Ma

zzucato presented a report ‘

Mission-Oriented Research & Innovation in the European Union - A problem-solving approach to fuel innovation-

led growth

’

in which she

recommended five key criteria for the selection of missions at Union level

.

Furthermore, the High-Level Strategy Group on industrial technologies, chaired by Professor Jürgen Rüttgers, proposed a redefinition of key enabling technologies and made recommendations for ways to maximise their contribution to inclusive growth and democracy, prosperity, more equality and better jobs.

An extensive list of reports from high level groups and studies are given in the annex to the impact assessment.

•

Impact assessment

This proposal is supported by an impact assessment. The opinion of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board was “positive with reservations”, recommending to better describe (i) the balance between the Programme pillars, (ii) the rati

onale and value added of the EIC and R&I Missions, and (iii) the streamlined delivery mechanisms

.

In a globally competitive, increasingly knowledge-based economy, R&I determine the productivity and competitiveness of an advanced economy like Europe’s: about two-thirds of Europe’s economic growth over the last decades has been driven by innovation. They drive and support the creation of new and better jobs, and the development of knowledge-intensive activities, which account for more than 33% of total employment in Europe. Europe must maintain and even step up its technological, industrial and innovation capacities in a sustainable way, in strategic areas that underpin our society, economy and international commitments.

More must be done to stimulate widespread innovation in Europe, which is at the basis of maintaining Europe's socio-economic model and values. The expected impacts of continuing the Programme were analysed in the impact assessment. Compared to the ongoing Programme, Horizon Europe is expected to generate:

·

new and more knowledge and technologies, promoting scientific excellence and significant scientific impact.

The Programme will continue to facilitate cross-border collaboration between top scientists and innovators, allowing for trans-natio

nal and cross-sector coordination between public and private R&I investment. Horizon 2020 has already attracted the world’s best research institutions and researchers, supported 340 000 researchers, and developed Europe’s skilled human capital. Scientific

publications from Horizon 2020 are world class (cited more than twice the world average) and have contributed to major scientific breakthroughs.

·

positive effects on growth, trade and investment

flows, and on quality jobs and international mobility for rese

archers in the European Research Area. The Programme is expected to increase GDP on average by 0.08% to 0.19% over 25 years, which means that each euro invested can potentially generate a return of up to 11 euro of GDP over the same period. Union investmen

ts in R&I are expected to directly generate an estimated gain of up to 100 000 jobs in R&I activities in the ‘investment phase’ (2021-2027). The economic activity generated by the Programme is expected to foster an indirect gain of up to 200 000 jobs over

2027-2036, of which 40% will be highly skilled.

·

significant social and environmental impact

. This impact will be created by disseminating, exploiting and taking up scientific results and translating them into new products, services and processes, which in

turn will help successfully deliver on political objectives, as well as social and eco-innovation.

These impacts mean that

the potential cost of discontinuing the Union R&I Programme (i.e. the cost of non-Europe) is substantial

. Discontinuation could resul

t in a decline of competitiveness and growth (up to EUR 720 billion of GDP loss over 25 years

), sharp reductions in the private and national investments that are currently leveraged by Union-level co-investments, and significant losses of social, environm

ental and economic impacts.

Moreover, the new Programme will further simplify rules, increase legal certainty and reduce administrative burden for beneficiaries and programme administrators.

•

Simplification

Simplification is key to reaching the objectives of Horizon Europe. To attract the best researchers and the most innovative entrepreneurs, the administrative burden of participating must be kept to a minimum.

The main simplification features set out, for the most part, in the rules for participation and dissemination are (further details further below):

–

Continuity

in the simplification measures applied to Horizon 2020 which were appreciated by participants, such as the three-pillar programme structure, the simple funding model and the Participant Port

al;

–

Simplification of the funding landscape

: the approach to partnership, for example, is streamlined, with only three types and a clear set of criteria for their selection and implementation, to ensure that they contribute to the general and specific

objectives of Horizon Europe;

–

Further simplification of the current real cost reimbursement system

, in particular as regards personnel costs;

–

Broader acceptance of beneficiaries’ usual accounting practice

, in particular for internal invoicing

and services which would also cover the equivalent to Horizon 2020 large research infrastructures;

–

Increased use of simplified cost options

, as provided for by the new Financial Regulation, in particular of lump-sum project funding in appropriate areas an

d taking account of the lessons from the pilot under Horizon 2020;

–

An increased cross-reliance on audits

to reduce the audit burden for beneficiaries taking part in several Union funding programmes;

–

Extending the Participants’ Guarantee Fund (renamed Mutua

l Insurance Mechanism)

to

beneficiaries of any directly managed Union programme,

and for actions not covered by the fund under Horizon 2020 (Article 185 Initiatives);

–

An acceptance of the

seal of excellence

, for which proposals may receive support from th

e European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund+ or the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development

;

–

Maintaining

key elements of the proposal evaluation

and selection process, throughout all parts of Horizon Europe. A

broader range of expertise will however be sought, in function of the scope of the calls, including expertise from user groups and civil society organisations

. The novelty of the missions-based approach will be to go from assessing excellence and impact

only at the level of individual proposals, to also assessing how excellent proposals fit together as a portfolio. While the main principles are spelled out in advance in the rules, the work programmes will provide further details on the application of the

award criteria depending on the objectives of the calls and instruments (e.g. the aspects to be taken into account in the evaluation procedures)

.

Beyond the Horizon Europe basic legal acts, steps will be taken to simplify the  implementation of the Programme, starting with the model grant agreements and covering all processes, documentation, helpdesks, support services, and IT systems, alleviating further the administrative burden for participants and accelerating the granting process. The Commission will develop such improved implementation tools in parallel with the legislative process, in consultation with stakeholders.

•

Fundamental rights

This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

4.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

The budget of all proposals is presented in current prices. The Commission may continue, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, to use executive agencies to implement of Horizon Europe.

5.

OTHER

ELEMENTS

•

Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements

The Commission may increase the share of the budget delegated to

executive agencies

, subject to the outcome of the mandatory cost-benefit analysis. Given the new elements

in the remit of the new Framework Programme (e.g. missions and the European Innovation Council) and the increased budget to be delegated, changes to agencies’ mandates will be needed

.

This approach will help reduce of administrative costs, improve synergies with other programmes and help focus more on performance.

Activities with a particularly substantial policy content are in principle excluded from delegation to executive agencies, but the feedback of R&I data and results from these agencies to the Commission will be stepped up in line with the dissemination and exploitation strategy, in order to strengthen the evidence-base for policy-making.

Evaluations will be carried out in line with paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 A

pril 2016

, where the three institutions confirmed that evaluations of existing legislation and policy should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action. The evaluations will assess the programme's effects on the ground based on

the programme indicators/targets and a detailed analysis of the degree to which the programme can be deemed relevant, effective, efficient, provides enough Union added value and is coherent with other Union policies. They will include lessons learnt to id

entify any deficiencies/problems or any potential to further improve the actions or their results and to help maximise their exploitation/impact.

In order to be able to better track and communicate the Programme’s impact, the Horizon Europe

monitoring and evaluation system

will have three main building blocks:

·

Annual monitoring of the programme performance: tracking of performance indicators in the short, medium and longer-term according to key impact pathways towards Programme objectives, based on

baselines and targets where possible;

·

Continuous collection of programme management and implementation data;

·

Two fully-fledged (meta)-evaluations of the programme at mid-term and ex-post (upon completion). These evaluations will build on the coordinated ev

aluations of each programme part, type of actions and delivery mechanism according to common evaluation criteria and standard methodologies and will inform adaptations to be made to the programme.

Impact pathways, and related key impact pathway indicators, will structure the annual monitoring of the programme performance towards its objectives. These pathways reflect three complementary impact categories, reflecting the non-linear nature of R&I investment:

1.

Scientific impact: related to supporting the cr

eation and diffusion of high-quality new knowledge, skills, technologies and solutions to global challenges;

2.

Societal impact: related to strengthening the impact of research and innovation in developing, supporting and implementing Union policies, and s

upport the uptake of innovative solutions in industry and society to address global challenges;

3.

Economic impact: related to fostering all forms of innovation, including breakthrough innovation, and strengthening market deployment of innovative solutions

.

For each of these impact categories, proxy indicators will be used to track on progress distinguishing between the short, medium and longer term.

Management and implementation data

for all parts of the Programme and all delivery mechanisms will continue

to be collected in close to real-time.

This data will be collected in a centrally managed and harmonised way. It will also continue to be publicly available on a dedicated on-line portal in close to real-time allowing extraction per programme parts, types

of actions and types of organisations (including specific data for SMEs). This will include inter alia proposals, applications, participations and projects (number, quality, Union contribution etc.); success rates; profiles of evaluators, applicants and p

articipants (partly based on unique identifiers, and including country, gender, turnover, role in project etc.); implementation (including time-to-grant, error rate, satisfaction rate and the rate of risk taking etc.); communication, dissemination and expl

oitation activities; and contribution to Union climate and environmental objectives.

In order to better track investments towards a knowledge-based society, information on the Union funding allocated to the exploitation and deployment of R&I results, notab

ly from the Framework Programmes, may be collected over the course of the programmes.

•

Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal

Horizon Europe is a new framework programme designed for maximum impact in the context of the evolving nature of research and innovation, with an architecture designed for enhanced coherence and performance. It is proposed to use a three-pillar structure, with each pillar interconnected with the others and complemented by underpinning activities, to strengthen the European Research Area.

The three-pillar structure

The first pillar on Open Science will ensure strong continuity with Horizon 2020 in supporting excellent science

within a bottom-up approach in order to reinforce the Union’s scientific leadership, high-quality knowledge and skills development, through the European Research Council, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and research infrastructures. The principles and practices of open science will be mainstreamed across the entire Programme.

The second pillar on Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness will take forward the societal challenges and industrial technologies

in a more ‘top down’ directed approach addressing Union and global policy and competitiveness challenges and opportunities These are integrated into five clusters (‘health’; ‘inclusive and secure society’; ‘digital and industry’; ‘climate, energy and mobility’; and ‘food and natural resources’), aligned with Union and global policy priorities (the Sustainable Development Goals) and having cooperation and competitiveness as key drivers. The integration in clusters, each having a number of intervention areas, is designed to incentivise cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, cross-policy and international collaboration, thereby achieving higher impact and better seizing the innovation potential that is often greatest at the intersection of disciplines and sectors.

Alongside the regular calls for proposals,

a limited set of highly visible missions will be introduced

. These will be designed in the context of a strategic planning process. Missions, with ambitious but time-bound and achievable goals, should speak to the public and engage it where relevant. They will be co-designed with Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens.

The second pillar embodies industry’s essential role in achieving all the Programme’s objectives. To ensure industrial competitiveness and the capacity to address the global challenges ahead, the Union needs to reinforce and maintain its technological and industrial capacities in key areas that underpin the transformation of our economy and society. Priority will be given to investments in the key enabling technologies of the future.

The second pillar will also provide scientific evidence and technical support to Union policies, including through the activities of the Joint Research Centre. This pillar will help realise Union policy objectives within the spirit of the Innovation Principle as put forward in the European Commission's Communication of 15 May 2018 on Research and Innovation: a renewed European agenda. Particular attention should be given to increasing the share of participation in research and funding of entities from low-to-mid income third countries.

While innovation will be supported throughout the whole programme, the

third pillar on Open Innovation will essentially focus on scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation by establishing a European Innovation Council

, support the enhancement of European ecosystems of innovation and continued support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The European Innovation Council will offer a one-stop-shop to high-potential innovators

.

Activities will be defined mainly bottom-up. This should significantly simplify and streamline current support, and fill any gap between the grant funding in other parts of Horizon Europe and the financial instruments of InvestEU. Support will also be provided for collaboration with and between national and regional innovation agencies but also any other public or private and general or sectoral actor of the European innovation landscape.

The European Institute of Innovation and Technology will complement the European Innovation Council by promoting sustainable innovation ecosystems and developing entrepreneurial and innovation skills in priority areas through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology will contribute to the entrepreneurial transformation of EU universities, and its activities will maximise synergies and complementarities with actions under the Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness Pillar.

Europe’s economic and social prosperity, the quality of life and jobs, and of the environment, depend on its ability to create knowledge and to innovate. The bottom-up approaches in the first and third pillars aim primarily at reinforcing excellence, creating knowledge and innovation and encouraging greater investment especially in new, fast-growing areas of cutting-edge science and breakthrough innovation with the potential to scale up. These are essential to address the knowledge and innovation gap and strengthen the Union’s scientific and technological bases, thereby supporting Union strategic objectives and policy priorities and contributing to long-term growth and competiveness.

The three pillars will be underpinned by

activities to strengthening the European Research Area

, specifically: sharing excellence to fully exploit the potential in less R&I performing countries so that they attain high Union standards of excellence (e.g., via teaming, twinning, ERA chairs); and reforming and enhancing the European R&I system, covering the next generation Policy Support Facility.

This part will also include activities on: foresight activities; monitoring and evaluating the Framework Programme and disseminating and exploiting results; modernising European universities; supporting enhanced international cooperation; and science, society and citizens.

The three-pillar structure will reinforce the

internal coherence of the different programme parts

towards achieving programme level objectives. The clearly defined and complementary rationales for intervention will enhance their interconnectivity, with open science and open innovation being common threads. It will ensure a systemic,

impact-based approach

that cuts across disciplines and silos for better impact. For example, missions will have a pull effect on activities in the open science and open innovation pillars, while innovations with rapid scale-up potential arising from collaborative research, the European Research Council's proof of concept or the EIT’s

Knowledge and Innovation Communities

will be rapidly signposted to the European Innovation Council. Strategic planning will reinforce the programme's internal coherence even more.

Cross-cutting elements

Horizon Europe will significantly

strengthen international cooperation

which is crucial to ensure access to talent, knowledge, know-how, facilities and markets worldwide, to effectively tackle global challenges and to implement global commitments. The Framework Programme will intensify cooperation and extend association agreements to include countries with excellent science, technology and innovation capacities. The Programme will continue to fund entities from low-to-mid income countries, and to fund entities from industrialised and emerging economies only if they possess essential competence or facilities.

The principle of open science

will become the modus operandi of the new Programme. It will go beyond the open access policy of Horizon 2020 and require open access to publications and data (with robust opt-outs for the latter), and to research data management plans. The Programme will foster the widespread use of FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable) data; and activities that enhance researchers’ skills in open science and support reward systems that promote open science. Research integrity and citizen science will play a central role, as will the development of a new generation of research assessment indicators.

Horizon Europe will take a

new and more impact-focussed

approach

to partnerships

. The current plethora of European Partnerships will be rationalised, so that they can continue in simplified forms that are open to all (such as academia, industry, Member States, and philanthropic foundations), while ensuring that they can effectively contribute to the general and specific objectives of Horizon Europe. They will be designed on the basis of Union added value, transparency, openness, impact, leverage effect, the long-term financial commitment of all the involved parties, flexibility, coherence and complementarity with Union, national and regional initiatives. This approach aims at a consolidated and rationalised number of partnerships that avoid overlaps and duplication and that are better aligned with Union policy priorities.

There will be three levels of partnerships:

(a)

co-programmed, based on memoranda of understanding or contractual arrangements with partners;

(b)

co-funded, based on a single, flexible programme co-fund action;

(c)

institutionalised partnerships (based on Articles 185 or 187 TFEU, and the EI

T Regulation for the

Knowledge and Innovation Communities

).

The areas for partnerships, including the possible continuation of existing ones, will be identified during the strategic planning process (the proposed legal basis sets out only the instruments and criteria that will guide their use). Proposals for future EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) will be indicated in the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA), and will take into account the outcomes of the strategic planning process. Themes will be identified and selected in a way that maximises complementarities and synergies with actions under the 'Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness' Pillar.

The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework set a more ambitious goal for climate

mainstreaming

across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. The contribution of this programme to the achievement of this overall target will be tracked through an EU climate marker system at an appropriate level of disaggregation, including the use of more precise methodologies where these are available. The Commission will continue to present the information annually in terms of commitment appropriations in the context of the annual draft budget.

To support the full utilisation of the potential of the programme to contribute to climate objectives, the Commission will seek to identify relevant actions throughout the programme preparation, implementation, review and evaluation processes.

Synergies

Synergies

between different Union programmes will be highly encouraged and enhanced through the strategic planning process, which will act as a reference framework for R&I support across the Union's budget. Effective and operational synergies will thus be ensured with other Union programmes, notably to develop a more effective science-policy interface and  address policy needs, as well as promote faster dissemination and uptake of research and innovation results and to enable the pursuit of common objectives and common areas for activities (such as partnership areas or mission areas).

These programmes would include, among others, the common agricultural policy (CAP); the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); the European Social Fund (ESF+); the European Space Programme; the Single Market Programme; the Programme for Environment & Climate Action (LIFE); the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF); the Digital Europe Programme (DEP); the Erasmus Programme; the InvestEU Fund; and the external action instruments (Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA III)). Particular attention will be paid to links with the European Semester and the Reform Delivery Tool, including via the Policy Support Facility.

In full complementarity with Horizon Europe, these programmes may provide support for research and innovation activities, including demonstration of solutions tailored to specific national/regional contexts/needs, as well as bilateral and interregional initiatives. In particular, the European Regional Development Fund will support the building of research and innovation eco-systems in the Member States in terms of infrastructures, human resources, modernisation of the public and private sectors, and (inter)regional cooperation networks, such as clusters structures.

Programmes such as the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the Digital Europe Programme (DEP), the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, or LIFE will make use of public procurement as a key instrument to deploy physical infrastructures and innovative technologies and solutions that can originate from Framework Programme activities and beyond.

The rules for participation and dissemination

The following main new features have been introduced in the

rules for participation and dissemination

:

·

The principle of a single set of rules will continue, but with further improvements.

In line with the corporate approach towards a single-r

ule book and the preparation of the MFF, the new Union Financial Regulation

will be used as a common reference under which the rules applicable to all Union funding programmes will be aligned.

·

Horizon 2020 funding rates will be maintained.

The funding rat

e will be a maximum that can be reduced when justified for implementing specific actions. This will ensure the programme remains attractive.

·

The cost reimbursement scheme will be further simplified,

in particular

in what concerns the actual costs scheme fo

r personnel costs: the distinction between basic and additional remuneration will be removed and the Horizon 2020 cap on the additional remuneration abolished.

·

Broader acceptance of the usual cost accounting practice

: the unit cost for internally invoiced

goods and services will make it possible to cover actual indirect costs calculated in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices.

·

A wider cross-reliance on audits and assessments – including with other Union programmes – is envisaged

. This shoul

d reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries of Union funds by further aligning the rules. The rules explicitly provide for cross-reliance by considering also other elements of assurance resulting in a need for fewer financial audits on beneficiarie

s that have positive results on their systems audits. Moreover, cross-reliance can be part of the conditions for lifting the obligation for the beneficiary to submit a certificate on the financial statement.

·

The

Participant Guarantee Fund (renamed Mutua

l Insurance Mechanism) will be extended

to all forms of institutionalised partnerships, including Article 185 initiatives not covered under Horizon 2020, and to beneficiaries from other directly managed Union programmes.

·

Dissemination and exploitation

: mos

t provisions of the Horizon 2020 rules for participation and dissemination are maintained, with further improvements where appropriate. This includes reinforcing the focus on exploitation, in particular within the Union and the role of the plan for the dis

semination and exploitation during and after the end of the project. Moreover, the Commission will provide dedicated support to dissemination, exploitation and knowledge diffusion and put more emphasis on promoting the exploitation of R&I results.

·

Communi

cation by the

beneficiaries of Union funds

:  in line with the recommendations of the Lamy report, the Rules underline the role of beneficiaries in providing coherent, effective and proportionate targeted information to multiple audiences, including the med

ia and the public. Building on experience in Horizon 2020, guidance to beneficiaries will show how they can become principal communicators of all aspects of their project activities.

·

Fostering open science

will ensure better exploitation of R&I results wit

hin the Union. This will assist market uptake, boost impact, maximise synergies with other Union initiatives and increase the innovation potential of results generated by Union funding.

The following actions are in particular envisaged:

·

Supporting R&I stak

eholders in fully endorsing the principle of the open access and working with them to make the European Open Science Cloud a reality;

·

Strengthening the European data space

that allows for unrestricted and constant knowledge and data circulation and creating the necessary incentives for programme beneficiaries and innovators to share their results and data for reuse.

·

Putting in place incentives for the exploitation of Progra

mme results by helping beneficiaries to find the most appropriate instruments and channels for market uptake of their innovation;

·

Putting in place a strategy for increasing the availability of R&I results and accelerating their uptake, including for policy

, thereby boosting the overall impact of the programme and the European innovation potential;

·

Providing holistic support throughout the dissemination and exploitation lifecycle to ensure a constant stream of innovation coming from the programme.

For Horizon Europe, the

award criteria

will be excellence; impact; and quality and efficiency of the implementation. These are the same criteria as for previous Framework Programmes.

The proposed Regulation specifies excellence as the sole criterion for the European Research Council (ERC), in line with the objective of advancing the frontiers of knowledge. This provision does not represent a deviation from the agreed need to boost impact in the Programme. In fact, impact can refer to scientific, technological, socio-economic or other types of impact. In the case of the ERC, the emphasis is on scientific impact, which is the foundation for many other types of impact, including socio-economic impact. The ERC will continue to set a clear and inspirational ambition for European science by creating pan-European competition for ideas and talent.

The European Institute for Innovation and Technology

The

European Institute for Innovation and Technology

, primarily through its

Knowledge and Innovation Communities

(KICs) will aim at strengthening innovation ecosystems that tackle global challenges, by fostering the integration of business, research, higher education and entrepreneurship.  While the EIT's focus on innovation ecosystems make it naturally fit within the Open Innovation pillar of Horizon Europe, the cross-pillar nature of the EIT can bring an additional targeted approach towards the global challenges highlighted in the programme. Proposals for future EIT KICs in compliance with the EIT Regulation will be indicated in the EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA) and will take into account the outcome of the strategic planning process and the priorities of the Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness pillar.

The Joint Research Centre (JRC)

While the

Joint Research Centre

will contribute broadly to other parts of Horizon Europe, the JRC will play a strong supporting role in the Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness pillar. In this context, it will continue to provide scientific advice and support to Union policy throughout the policy cycle.

2018/0224 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

establishing Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research

and Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 173(3), Article 182(1), Article 183, and the second paragraph of Article 188 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion

of the European Economic and Social Committee

,

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure

,

Whereas:

(1)

It is the Union's objective to strengthen its scientific and techno

logical bases and encourage its competitiveness, including in its industry, while promoting all research and innovation activities to deliver on the Union's strategic priorities, which ultimately aim at promoting peace, the Union's values and the well-bein

g of its peoples.

(2)

To deliver scientific, economic and societal impact in pursuit of this general objective, the Union should invest in research and innovation through Horizon Europe - a Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2021-2027 (the ‘P

rogramme’) to support the creation and diffusion of high-quality knowledge and technologies, to strengthen the impact of research and innovation in developing, supporting and implementing Union policies, to support the uptake of innovative solutions in ind

ustry and society to address global challenges and promote industrial competitiveness; to foster all forms of innovation, including breakthrough innovation, and strengthen market deployment of innovative solutions; and optimise the delivery of such investm

ent for increased impact within a strengthened European Research Area.

(3)

The promotion of research and innovation activities deemed necessary to help realise Union policy objectives should take into account the innovation principle as put forward in the

Commission  Communication of 15 May 2018 'A renewed European Agenda for Research and Innovation - Europe's chance to shape its future' (COM(2018)306)

.

(4)

Open Science, Open Innovation, Open to the World  constitute general principles, which should ensure

excellence and impact of the Union's investment in research and innovation. They should be adhered in the implementation of the Programme, in particular for the strategic planning in respect of the pillar 'Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness'.

(5)

Open science, including open access to scientific publications and research data, has the potential to increase the quality, impact and benefits of science and to accelerate the advancement of knowledge by making it more reliable, more efficient and

accurate, better understandable by society and responsive to societal challenges. Provisions should be laid down to ensure that beneficiaries provide open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications, research data and other research outputs in an open

and non-discriminatory manner, free of charge and as early as possible in the dissemination process, and to enable their widest possible use and re-use. More emphasis should in particular be given to the responsible management of research data, which shoul

d comply with the FAIR principles of ‘Findability’, ‘Accessibility’, ‘Interoperability’ and ‘Reusability’, notably through the mainstreaming of Data Management Plans. Where appropriate, beneficiaries should make use of the possibilities offered by the Euro

pean Open Science Cloud and adhere to further open science principles and practices.

(6)

The conception and design of the Programme should respond to the need for establishing a critical mass of supported activities, throughout the EU Union and through int

ernational cooperation, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Programme implementation should reinforce the pursuit of this aim.

(7)

Activities supported under the Programme should contribute towards the achievement of the Union's obj

ectives and priorities, the monitoring and assessment of progress against those objectives and priorities and for the development of revised or new priorities.

(8)

The Programme should maintain a balanced approach between bottom-up (investigator or innova

tor driven) and top-down (determined by strategically defined priorities) funding, according to the nature of the research and innovation communities that are engaged, the types and purpose of the activities carried out and the impacts that are sought.  Th

e mix of these factors should determine the choice of approach for the respective parts of the Programme, all of which contribute to all of the Programme’s general and specific objectives.

(9)

Research activities carried out under the pillar 'Open Science'

should be determined according to the needs and opportunities of science. The research agenda should be set in close liaison with the scientific community. Research should be funded on the basis of excellence.

(10)

The pillar 'Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness' should be established through clusters of research and innovation activities, in order to maximise integration across the respective work areas while securing high and sustainable levels of impa

ct in relation to the resources that are expended. It will encourage cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, cross-policy and cross-border collaboration in pursuit of the UN SDGs and the competitiveness of the Union's industries therein.

(11)

Full engagement

of industry in the Programme, at all levels from the individual entrepreneur and small and medium-sized enterprises to large scale enterprises, should constitute one of the main channels through which the Programme's objectives are to be realised, specific

ally towards the creation of sustainable jobs and growth. Industry should contribute to the perspectives and priorities established through the strategic planning process which should support the development of work programmes. Such engagement by industry

should see its participation in the actions supported at levels at least commensurate with those under the previous framework programme Horizon 2020 established by Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council

('Horizon 2020').

(12)

It is important to support industry to stay or become world leader in innovation, digitisation and decarbonisation, notably through investments in key enabling technologies that will underpin tomorrow's business. The Programme's actions should be used

to address market failures or sub-optimal investment situations, in a proportionate manner, without duplicating or crowding out private financing and have a clear European added value. This will ensure consistency between the actions of the programme and E

U State aid rules, avoiding undue distortions of competition in the internal market.

(13)

The Programme should support research and innovation in an integrated manner, respecting all relevant provisions of the World Trade Organisation. The concept of resea

rch, including experimental development should be used in accordance with the Frascati Manual developed by the OECD, whereas the concept of innovation should be used in accordance with the Oslo Manual developed by the OECD and Eurostat, following a broad a

pproach that covers social innovation. The OECD definitions regarding Technological Readiness Level (TRL) should continue, as in the previous Framework Programme Horizon 2020, to be taken into account in the classification of technological research, produc

t development and demonstration activities, and the definition of types of action available in calls for proposals. In principle grants should not be awarded for actions where activities go above TRL 8. The work programme for a given call under the pillar

'Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness' could allow grants for large-scale product validation and market replication.

(14)

The Commission's Communication on the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020 (COM(2018) 2 final) has provided a set of recomm

endations for this Programme, including its Rules for participation and dissemination, building on the lessons learnt from the previous Programme as well as input from EU institutions and stakeholders. Those recommendations include to invest more ambitious

ly in order to reach critical mass and maximise impact;  to support breakthrough innovation; to prioritise Union research and innovation (R&I) investments in areas of high added value, notably through mission-orientation, citizen involvement and wide commu

nication; to rationalise the Union funding landscape, including by streamlining the range of partnership initiatives and co-funding schemes; the development of more and concrete synergies between different Union funding instruments, notably with the aim of

helping to mobilise under-exploited R&I potential across the Union; to strengthen international cooperation and reinforce openness to third countries' participation; and to continue simplification based on implementation experiences from Horizon 2020.

(15)

The Programme should seek synergies with other Union programmes, from their design and strategic planning, to project selection, management, communication, dissemination and exploitation of results, to monitoring, auditing and governance. With a view to

avoiding overlaps and duplication and increasing the leverage of Union funding, transfers from other Union programmes to Horizon Europe activities can take place. In such cases they will follow Horizon Europe rules.

(16)

In order to achieve the greatest po

ssible impact of Union funding and the most effective contribution to the Union's policy objectives, the Programme should enter into European Partnerships with private and/or public sector partners. Such partners include industry, research organisations, b

odies with a public service mission at local, regional, national or international level, and civil society organisations such as foundations that support and/or carry out research and innovation, provided that desired impacts can be achieved more effective

ly in partnership than by the Union alone.

(17)

The Programme should strengthen cooperation between European Partnerships and private and/or public sector partners at the international level including by joining up research and innovation programmes and cr

oss-border investment in research and innovation bringing mutual benefits to people and businesses while ensuring that the EU can uphold its interests in strategic areas.

(18)

The Joint Research Centre (JRC) should continue to provide Union policies with

independent customer-driven scientific evidence and technical support throughout the whole policy cycle. The direct actions of the JRC should be implemented in a flexible, efficient and transparent manner, taking into account the relevant needs of the user

s of the JRC and the needs of Union policies, and ensuring the protection of the financial interests of the Union.

The JRC should continue to generate additional resources.

(19)

The pillar 'Open Innovation' should establish a series of measures for integrated support to the needs of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship aiming at realising and accelerating breakthrough innovation for rapid market growth. It should attract innovative

companies with potential for scaling up at international and at Union level and offer fast, flexible grants and co-investments, including with private investors. These objectives should be pursued through the creation of a European Innovation Council (EIC)

. This Pillar should also support the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and European innovation ecosystems at large, notably through co-funding partnerships with national and regional innovation support actors.

(20)

The policy objectiv

es of this Programme will be also addressed through financial instruments and budgetary guarantee under the policy windows of the InvestEU Fund. Financial support should be used to address market failures or sub-optimal investment situations, in a proporti

onate manner and actions should not duplicate or crowd out private financing or distort competition in the Internal market. Actions should have a clear European added value.

(21)

The EIC through its instruments – Pathfinder and Accelerator – should aim at

identifying, developing and deploying breakthrough market creating innovations and supporting their rapid scale-up to EU and international levels. Through coherent and streamlined support to breakthrough innovation the EIC should fill the current vacuum i

n public support and private investment for breakthrough innovation. The instruments of the EIC call for dedicated legal and management features in order to reflect its objectives, in particular market deployment activities.

(22)

Through EIC blended fina

nce, the Accelerator should bridge the “valley of death” between research, pre-mass commercialisation and the scaling-up of companies. In particular, the Accelerator should provide support to operations presenting such technological or market risks that th

ey are not considered as bankable and cannot leverage significant investments from the market, hence complementing the InvestEU programme established by Regulation …

..

(23)

The EIT, primarily through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), shou

ld aim at strengthening innovation ecosystems that tackle global challenges, by fostering the integration of business, research, higher education and entrepreneurship. The EIT should foster innovation in its activities and should support the integration of

higher education within the innovation ecosystem, in particular by: stimulating entrepreneurial education, fostering strong non-disciplinary collaborations between industry and academia; and identifying prospective skills for future innovators to address

global challenges, which includes advanced digital and innovation skills. Support schemes provided by the EIT should benefit to EIC beneficiaries, while start-ups emerging from EIT KICs should have access to EIC actions. While the EIT’s focus on innovation

ecosystems should make it naturally fit within the pillar 'Open Innovation', the planning of its KICs should be aligned through the strategic planning process with the pillar 'Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness'.

(24)

Ensuring and preservi

ng a level playing field for companies that compete in a given market should be a key requirement for breakthrough or disruptive innovation to flourish thereby enabling in particular small and medium-size innovators to reap the benefits of their investment

and to capture a share of the market.

(25)

The Programme should promote and integrate cooperation with third countries and international organisations and initiatives based on common interest, mutual benefit and global commitments to implement the UN SD

Gs. International cooperation should aim to strengthen the Union's research and innovation excellence, attractiveness and economic and industrial competitiveness, to tackle global challenges, as embodied in the UN SDGs, and to support the Union's external

policies. An approach of general opening for international participation and targeted international cooperation actions should be followed, including through appropriate eligibility for funding of entities established in low to middle income countries. At

the same time, association of third countries to the Programme should be promoted.

(26)

With the aim of deepening the relationship between science and society and maximising benefits of their interactions, the Programme should engage and involve citizens a

nd civil society organisations in co-designing and co-creating responsible research and innovation agendas and contents, promoting science education, making scientific knowledge publicly accessible, and facilitating participation by citizens and civil soci

ety organisations  in its activities. It should do so across the Programme and through dedicated activities in the part 'Strengthening the European Research Area'. The engagement of citizens and civil society in research and innovation should be coupled wi

th public outreach activities to generate and sustain public support for the Programme. The programme should also seek to remove barriers and boost synergies between science, technology, culture and the arts to obtain a new quality of sustainable innovatio

n.

(27)

Pursuant to Article 349 of the TFEU, the Union's outermost regions are entitled to specific measures (taking into account their structural, social and economic situation) regarding access to horizontal Union programmes. The Programme should therefo

re take into account the specific characteristics of those regions in line with the Commission's Communication on 'A stronger and renewed strategic partnership with the EU's outermost regions' (COM (2017) 623 final) as endorsed by the Council on 12 April 2

018.

(28)

The activities developed under the Programme should aim at eliminating gender inequalities and promoting equality between women and men in research and innovation, in compliance with Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 8

of the TFEU. The gender dimension should be adequately integrated in research and innovation content and followed through at all stages of the research cycle.

(29)

In light of the specificities of the defence industry sector, the detailed provisions for U

nion funding to defence research projects should be fixed in the Regulation … establishing the European Defence Fund

which defines the rules of participation for defence research. Research and innovation activities carried out under the European Defence F

und should have an exclusive focus on defence applications.

(30)

This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the

Programme

.

The amount indicated for the specific programme referred to in Article 1(3)(a)

is to constitute the prime reference amount,

within the meaning of [

reference to be updated as appropriate according to the new inter-institutional agreement:

point 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary d

iscipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management

], for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure.

(31)

Regulation (EU, Euratom) No

[the new FR]

(the ‘Financial Regulation’) applies to thi

s Programme, unless otherwise specified. It lays down rules on the implementation of the Union budget, including the rules on grants, prizes, procurement, indirect implementation,

financial assistance,

financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.

(32)

I

n accordance with the Financial Regulation, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council

, Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2988/95

,Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96

and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939

, the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities, including fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used a

nd, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out administrative  investigat

ions, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the Europea

n Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council

. In accordance wit

h the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the EPPO and the European Court of Auditors

(ECA) and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights

.

(33)

Pursuant to [reference to be updated as appropriate according to a new decision on OCTs: Article 94 of Council Decision 2013/755/EU

], p

ersons and entities established in overseas countries and territories (OCTs) are eligible for funding subject to the rules and objectives of the Programme and possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or te

rritory is linked.

(34)

Pursuant to paragraph 22 and 23 of the Inter-institutional agreement for Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016, there is a need to evaluate this Programme on the basis of information collected through specific monitoring requirements,

while avoiding overregulation and administrative burdens, in particular on Member States. These requirements, where appropriate, can include measurable indicators, as a basis for evaluating the effects of the Programme on the ground.

(35)

In order to be ab

le to supplement or amend the impact pathway indicators, where considered necessary, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular im

portance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law

-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have acc

ess to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

(36)

Coherence and synergies between Horizon Europe and the EU's Space Programme will foster a globally competitive and innovative European space sector; reinforce

Europe’s autonomy in accessing and using space in a secure and safe environment; and strengthen Europe’s role as a global actor. Breakthrough solutions in Horizon Europe will be supported by data and services made available by the Space Programme.

(37)

T

he rules for participation and dissemination should adequately reflect the needs of the Programme taking into account the concerns raised and the recommendations made by various stakeholders.

(38)

Common rules across the Programme should ensure a coheren

t framework which facilitates participation in programmes financially supported by the budget of the Programme, including participation in programmes managed by funding bodies such as the EIT, joint undertakings or any other structures under Article 187 TF

EU, and participation in programmes undertaken by Member States pursuant to Article 185 TFEU. Flexibility to adopt specific rules should be ensured when justified.

(39)

Actions which fall within the scope of the Programme should respect fundamental rights

and observe the principles acknowledged in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Such actions should be in conformity with any legal obligation including international law and with any relevant Commission decisions such as

the Commission notice of 28 June 2013

, as well as with ethical principles, which include avoiding any breach of research integrity. Article 13 TFEU should also be taken into account in research activities, and the use of animals in research and testing sh

ould be reduced, with a view ultimately to replacing their use.

(40)

In line with the objectives of international cooperation as set out in Articles 180 and 186 TFEU, the participation of legal entities established in third countries and of international o

rganisations should be promoted. The implementation of the Programme should be in conformity with the measures adopted in accordance with Articles 75 and 215 TFEU and should be in compliance with international law. For actions related to Union strategic as

sets, interests, autonomy or security, the participation to specific actions of the Programme may be limited to entities established in Member States only, or to entities established in specified associated or other third countries in addition to Member St

ates.

(41)

Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this Programme will contribute to mainstream climate actions and t

o the achievement of an overall target of 25 % of the EU budget expenditures supporting climate objectives.

(42)

Horizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of t

he European Union apply to this Regulation. These rules are laid down in the Financial Regulation and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, procurement, prizes, indirect implementation, and provi

de for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also concern the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States, as the respect fo

r the rule of law is an essential precondition for sound financial management and effective EU funding.

(43)

Use of sensitive background information or access by unauthorized individuals to sensitive results may have an adverse impact on the interests of t

he Union or of one or more of the Member States. Thus handling of confidential data and classified information should be governed by all relevant Union law, including the Institutions' internal rules, such as Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, whi

ch lays down the provisions on security rules for protecting EU classified information.

(44)

It is necessary to establish the minimum conditions for participation, both as a general rule where the consortium should include at least one legal entity from a

Member State, and with regard to the specificities of particular type of actions under the Programme.

(45)

It is appropriate to establish the terms and conditions for providing Union funding to participants in actions under the Programme. Grants should

be implemented taking into account all forms of contribution set out in the Financial Regulation, including lump sums, flat rates or unit costs, with the view to further simplification.

(46)

The funding rates in this Regulation are referred to as maximums

in order to comply with the co-financing principle.

(47)

In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the Programme should provide the basis for a wider acceptance of the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiaries as regards personnel costs and

unit costs for internally invoiced goods and services.

(48)

The current system of reimbursement of actual personnel costs should be further simplified building on the project-based remuneration approach developed under Horizon 2020 and further aligned to

the Financial Regulation.

(49)

The participant Guarantee Fund set up under Horizon 2020 and managed by the Commission has proved to be an important safeguard mechanism which mitigates the risks associated with the amounts due and not reimbursed by defau

lting participants. Therefore, the Beneficiary Guarantee Fund, renamed Mutual Insurance Mechanism ("the Mechanism") should be continued and enlarged to other funding bodies in particular to initiatives pursuant to Article 185 of the TFEU. The Mechanism sho

uld be opened to beneficiaries of any other directly managed Union programme.

(50)

Rules governing the exploitation and dissemination of results should be laid down to ensure that beneficiaries protect, exploit, disseminate and provide access to those resu

lts as appropriate. More emphasis should be given to exploiting the results, in particular in the Union. Beneficiaries should update their plans regarding the exploitation and dissemination of their results during and after the end of the action.

(51)

The

key elements of the proposal evaluation and selection system of the predecessor programme Horizon 2020 with its particular focus on excellence should be maintained. Proposals should continue to be selected based on the evaluation made by independent exper

ts. Where relevant, the necessity to ensure the overall coherence of the portfolio of projects should be taken into account.

(52)

A wider cross-reliance on audits and assessments – including with other Union programmes – should be envisaged, in order to r

educe administrative burden for beneficiaries of Union funds. Cross reliance should be explicitly provided for by considering also other elements of assurance such as systems and processes audits.

(53)

Specific challenges in the area of research of innova

tion should be addressed by prizes, including through common or joint prizes where appropriate, organised by the Commission or funding body with other Union bodies, third countries, international organisations or non-profit legal entities.

(54)

The types o

f financing and the methods of implementation under this Regulation shall be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the admin

istrative burden, and the expected risk of non-compliance. For grants, this shall include consideration of the use of lump sums, flat rates and scales of unit costs.

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

TITLE I

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Article 1

Subject matter

1.

Thi

s Regulation establishes Horizon Europe - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (‘the Programme’) and the rules for participation and dissemination in indirect actions under the Programme.

2.

It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the

budget for the period 2021 – 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.

3.

The Programme shall be implemented through:

(a)

the specific programme established by Decision …/…/EU

, which includes a financial contribution to th

e EIT;

(b)

the specific programme on defence research established by Regulation …/…/EU.

(a)

to the Commission under Decision No 1982/2006/EC,

(b)

to the Commission and Union bodi

es under "Horizon 2020",

(c)

to the Commission and funding bodies under the Programme.

The coverage of the risk regarding funding bodies referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph may be implemented through an indirect coverage system set out in the applicable agreement and taking into account the nature of the funding body.

2.

The Mechanism  shall be managed by the Union, represented by the Commission acting as executive agent. The Commission shall set up specific rules for the operation of the Fund.

3.

Beneficiaries shall make a contribution of 5 % of the Union funding for the action. On the basis of periodic evaluations, this contribution may be raised by the Commission up to 8% or may be reduced under 5%. The beneficiaries' contribution to the Mecha

4.

The contribution of the beneficiaries shall be returned at the payment of the balance.

5.

Any financial return generated by the Mechanism shall be

added to the Mechanism. If the return is insufficient, the Mechanism shall not intervene and the Commission or funding body shall recover directly from beneficiaries or third parties any amount owed.

Article 34

Ownership and protection

1.

Beneficiaries shall own the results they generate. They shall ensure that any rights of their employees or any other parties in relation to the results can be exercised in a manner compatible with the benefici

aries’ obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in the grant agreement.

Two or more beneficiaries shall own results jointly if:

(a)

they have jointly generated them; and

(b)

it is not possible to:

(i)

establish the respective contribution of each beneficiary,

or

(ii)

separate them when applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection.

The joint owners shall agree in writing on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership. Unless otherwise agreed, each joint owner may grant non-exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the jointly-owned results (without any right to sub-license), if the other joint owners are given advance notice and fair and reasonable compensation. The joint owners may agree in writing to apply another regime than joint ownership.

2.

Beneficiaries having received Union funding shall adequately protect their results if protection is possible and justified, taking into account all relevant considerations, inc

luding the prospects for commercial exploitation. When deciding on protection, beneficiaries shall also consider the legitimate interests of the other beneficiaries in the action.

Article 35

Exploitation and dissemination

1.

Beneficiaries having received

Union funding shall use their best efforts to exploit their results, in particular in the Union. Exploitation may be done directly by the beneficiaries or indirectly in particular through the transfer and licensing of results in accordance with Article 36.

The work programme may provide for additional exploitation obligations.

If despite a beneficiary's best efforts to exploit its results directly or indirectly no exploitation takes place within a given period as identified in the grant agreement, the beneficiary shall use an appropriate online platform as identified in the grant agreement to find interested parties to exploit those results. If justified on the basis of a request of the beneficiary, this obligation may be waived.

2.

Subject to any restricti

ons due to the protection of intellectual property, security rules or legitimate interests, beneficiaries shall disseminate their results as soon as possible.

The work programme may provide for additional dissemination obligations.

3.

Beneficiaries shall e

nsure that open access to scientific publications applies under the terms and conditions laid down in the grant agreement. In particular, the beneficiaries shall ensure that they or the authors retain sufficient intellectual property rights to comply with

their open access requirements.

Open access to research data shall be the general rule under the terms and conditions laid down in the grant agreement, but exceptions shall apply if justified, taking into consideration the legitimate interests of the beneficiaries and any other constraints, such as data protection rules, security rules or intellectual property rights.

The work programme may provide for additional obligations to adhere to open science practices.

4.

Beneficiaries shall manage all research da

ta in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in the grant agreement and shall establish a Data Management Plan.

The work programme may provide for additional obligations to use the European Open Science Cloud for storing and giving access to research data.

5.

Beneficiaries that intend to disseminate their results shall give advance notice to the other beneficiaries in the action. Any other beneficiary may object if it can show that the intended dissemination would significantly harm its legitim

ate interests in relation to its results or background. In such cases, the dissemination may not take place unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard these legitimate interests.

6.

Unless the work programme provides otherwise, proposals shall include

a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results. If the expected exploitation entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan shall include a strategy for such e

xploitation. If the plan provides for exploitation primarily in non-associated third countries, the legal entities shall explain how that exploitation

is still in the Union interest

.

The beneficiaries shall further develop the plan during and after the end of the action.

7.

For the purposes of monitoring and dissemination by the Commission or funding body, the beneficiaries shall provide any requested information regarding the exploitation and dissemination of their results. Subject to the legitimate int

erests of the beneficiaries, such information shall be made publicly available.

Article 36

Transfer and licensing

1.

Beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results. They shall ensure that their obligations also apply to the new owner and that the l

atter has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer.

2.

Unless agreed otherwise in writing for specifically-identified third parties or unless impossible under applicable law, beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership of results shal

l give advance notice to any other beneficiary that still has access rights to the results. The notification must include sufficient information on the new owner to enable a beneficiary to assess the effects on its access rights.

Unless agreed otherwise in writing for specifically-identified third parties, a beneficiary may object to the transfer if it can show that the transfer would adversely affect its access rights. In this case, the transfer may not take place until agreement has been reached between the beneficiaries concerned.

3.

Beneficiaries may grant licences to their results or otherwise give the right to exploit them, if this does not affect compliance with their obligations.

4.

Where this is justified, the grant agreement shall lay down the rig

ht to object to transfers of ownership of results, or to grants of an exclusive licence regarding results, if:

(a)

the beneficiaries generating the results have received Union funding;

(b)

the transfer or licence is to a legal entity established in a non-a

ssociated third country; and

(c)

the transfer or licence is not in line with Union interests.

If the right to object applies, the beneficiary shall give advance notice. The right to object may be waived in writing regarding transfers or grants to specifically identified legal entities if measures safeguarding Union interests are in place.

Unless otherwise agreed by the beneficiaries, they shall also grant access to their results and, subject to any restrictions referred to in paragraph 1(c), to their background to a legal entity that:

(a)

is established in a Member State or associated

country;

(b)

ANNEX V

KEY IMPACT PATHWAY INDICATORS

Impact pathways, and related key impact pathway indicators, shall structure the monitoring of the Framework Programme’s (FP) performance towards its objectives. The impact pathways are time-sensitive: they distinguish between the short, medium and long term. Impact pathway indicators serve as proxies to report on the progress made towards each type of Research and Innovation (R&I) impact at the FP-level. Individual Programme parts will contribute to these indicators to a different degree and through different mechanisms. Additional indicators may be used to monitor individual programme parts, where relevant.

The micro-data behind the key impact pathway indicators will be collected for all parts of the Programme and all delivery mechanisms in a centrally managed and harmonised way and at the appropriate level of granularity with minimal reporting burden on the beneficiaries.

Scientific impact pathway indicators

The Programme is expected to have scientific impact by creating high-quality new knowledge, strengthening human capital in research and innovation, and fostering diffusion of knowledge and Open Science. Progress towards this impact will be monitored through proxy indicators set along the following three key impact pathways.
