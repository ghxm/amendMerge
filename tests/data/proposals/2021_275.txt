COM(2021) 483 final

2021/0275(COD)

Proposal for a

DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road (codification)

(Text with EEA relevance)

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

In the context of a peopleâ€™s Europe, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying the law of the Union so as to make it clearer and more accessible to citizens, thus giving them new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives them.

This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.

For this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent.

2.

On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided

to instruct its staff that all legislative acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable.

3.

The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (DecemberÂ 1992) confirmed this

, stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.

Codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.

Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.

4.

The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council DirectiveÂ 95/50/EC of 6Â October 1995 on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road

.

The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it

; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

5.

The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 24 official languages, of Directive 95/50/EC and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in AnnexÂ V to the codified Directive.

91

âŒ«

thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

,

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

ðŸ¡»

(1)

Council Directive 95/50/EC

has been substantially amended several times

. In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Directive should be codified.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 2 (adapted)

(2)

Checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road

âŒ¦

should be

âŒ«

carried out in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1100/2008 of the

European Parliament and of the Council

and Council RegulationÂ (EEC) NoÂ 3912/92

.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 3 (adapted)

type of transport should

âŒ¦

ensure that

âŒ«

compliance with the safety standards laid down in

âŒ¦

Directive 2008/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

âŒ«

âŒ¦

may

âŒ«

be verified effectively.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 4

(4)

Member States should ensure a sufficient level of checks on the vehicles concerned throughout their territory while, where possible, avoiding the proliferation of such checks.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 6 (adapted)

(5)

Checks should be carried out using a list of common items applicable to

âŒ¦

the

âŒ«

transport

âŒ¦

of dangerous goods

âŒ«

throughout the

âŒ¦

Union

âŒ«

.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 7 (adapted)

(6)

It is necessary to

âŒ¦

lay down

âŒ«

a list of infringements deemed sufficiently serious by all Member States to result in the application to the vehicles concerned of appropriate measures depending on the circumstances or the requirements of safety, including, where appropriate, refusal to admit the vehicles concerned to the

âŒ¦

Union

âŒ«

.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 8 (adapted)

(7)

In order to

âŒ¦

ensure

âŒ«

compliance with safety standards for the transport of dangerous goods by road, it is necessary to make provision for checks to be carried out in undertakings as a preventive measure or when serious infringements of laws on the transport of dangerous goods have been recorded at the roadside.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 9

(8)

The checks in question should apply to all consignments of dangerous goods transported by road wholly or partly within the territory of the Member States, irrespective of the point of departure or the destination of the goods or the country in which the vehicle is registered.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 10

(9)

In the event of serious or repeated infringements, the competent authorities of the Member State in which the vehicle is registered or in which the undertaking is established may be asked to take appropriate measures and they should inform the requesting Member State of any follow-up measures taken.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 11

(10)

The application of this Directive should be monitored on the basis of a report to be submitted by the Commission.

ðŸ¡»

2019/1243 Art. 1 and Annex, pt. IX(1), introductory wording (adapted)

(11)

In order to adapt

âŒ¦

this

âŒ«

Directive to scientific and technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with ArticleÂ 290

âŒ¦

of the Treaty

on the Functioning of the European Union

âŒ«

should be delegated to the Commission

âŒ¦

in respect of

amending

âŒ«

Annexes

I, II and III

, in particular to take account of amendments to DirectiveÂ 2008/68/EC. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13Â April 2016 on Better Law-Making

. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member Statesâ€™ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC recital 5 (adapted)

(12)

âŒ¦

Since the objective of this Directive, namely providing for a high level of safety as regards the transport of dangerous goods, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of such an action, be better achieved atÂ Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with

âŒ«

the principle of subsidiarity

âŒ¦

as set out in ArticleÂ 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective

âŒ«

.

ðŸ¡»

(13)

This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for the transposition into national law of the Directives set out in AnnexÂ IV, PartÂ B,

ðŸ¡»

95/50/EC (adapted)

Union

âŒ«

.

Article 6

1. Checks may also be carried out at the premises of undertakings, as a preventive measure or where infringements which jeopardise safety in the transport of dangerous goods have been recorded at the roadside.

The purpose of such checks shall be to ensure that safety conditions for the transport of dangerous goods by road comply with the relevant laws.

2. Where one or more infringements, in particular those listed in AnnexÂ II, have been established in respect of the transport of dangerous goods by road, the transport in question shall be brought into conformity before the goods leave the undertaking or shall be subject to other appropriate measures.

Article 7

1. Member States shall assist one another in order to give proper effect to this Directive.

2. Serious or repeated infringements jeopardising the safety of the transport of dangerous goods committed by a non-resident vehicle or undertaking must be reported to the competent authorities

the Member State in which the vehicle is registered or in which the undertaking is established.

The competent authorities of the Member State in which serious or repeated infringements have been recorded may ask the competent authorities of the Member State in which the vehicle is registered or in which the undertaking is established for appropriate measures to be taken with regard to the offender or offenders.

The latter competent authorities shall notify the competent authorities of the Member State in which the infringements were recorded of any measures taken with regard to the transporter or the undertaking.

Article 8

If the findings of a roadside check on a vehicle registered in another Member State give grounds for believing that serious or repeated infringements have been committed which cannot be detected in the course of that check in the absence of the necessary data, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall assist one another in order to clarify the situation.

Where, to that end, the competent Member State carries out a check in the undertaking, the other Member States concerned shall be notified of the results.

Article 9

1. Each Member State shall send the Commission for each calendar year not later than twelve months after the end of that year a report, drawn up in accordance with the model

ANNEX II

Infringements

For the purposes of this Directive, the following non-exhaustive list, classified into three risk categories (category I being the most serious), gives a guideline on what is to be regarded as

âŒ¦

an

âŒ«

infringement.

The determination of the appropriate risk category must take account of the particular circumstances and be left to the discretion of the enforcing body/officer at the roadside.

Failures that are not listed under the risk categories shall be classified according to the descriptions of the categories.

In the event

âŒ¦

that

âŒ«

there are several infringements per transport unit, only the most serious risk category (as indicated under item 39 in AnnexÂ I) shall be applied for reporting purposes (

âŒ¦

in compliance with the model standard form set out in

âŒ«

AnnexÂ III).

1.

Risk Category I

Where failure to comply with relevant ADR provisions creates a high-level risk of death, serious personal injury or significant damage to the environment

,

such failures would normally lead to taking immediate and appropriate corrective measures such as immobilisation of the vehicle.

Failures are:

1.

the dangerous goods being carried are prohibited for transport;

2.

leakage of dangerous substances;

3.

carriage by a prohibited mode or an inappropriate means of transport;

4.

carriage in bulk in a container which is not structurally serviceable;

5.

carriage in a vehicle without an appropriate certificate of approval;

6.

the vehicle no longer complies with the approval standards and presents an immediate danger (otherwise it goes in risk category II);

7.

non-approved packaging is used;

8.

âŒ¦

the

âŒ«

packaging does not conform to the applicable packing instruction;

9.

the special provisions for mixed packing have not been complied with;

10.

the rules governing the securing and stowage of the load have not been complied with;

11.

the rules governing mixed loading of packages have not been complied with;

12.

the permissible degrees of filling of tanks or packages have not been complied with;

13.

the provisions limiting the quantities carried in one transport unit have not been complied with;

14.

carriage of dangerous goods without any indication of their presence (for example, documents, marking and labelling on the packages, placarding and marking on the vehicle);

15.

carriage without any placarding and marking on the vehicle;

16.

information relevant to the substance being carried enabling determination of a risk categoryÂ I offence is missing (for example, UN number, proper shipping name, packing group);

17.

âŒ¦

the

âŒ«

driver does not hold a valid vocational training certificate;

18.

fire or an unprotected light is being used;

19.

the ban on smoking is not being observed.

2.

Risk Category II

Where failure to comply with relevant ADR provisions creates a risk of personal injury or damage to the environment

,

such failures would normally lead to taking appropriate corrective measures such as requiring rectification at the site of control if possible and appropriate, but at the completion of the current transport movement at the latest.

Failures are:

1.

the transport unit comprises more than one trailer/semi-trailer;

2.

the vehicle no longer complies with the approval standards but does not present an immediate danger;

3.

the vehicle is not carrying operational fire extinguishers as required; a fire extinguisher

âŒ¦

may

âŒ«

still be deemed operational if only the prescribed seal and/or the expiry date are missing; however, this

âŒ¦

shall

âŒ«

not apply if the fire extinguisher is visibly no longer operational, for example, pressure gauge atÂ 0;

4.

the vehicle does not carry the equipment required in the ADR or in the instructions in writing;

5.

test and inspection dates and use periods of packaging, IBCs or large packaging have not been complied with;

6.

packages with damaged packaging, IBCs or large packaging or damaged uncleaned empty packaging are being carried;

7.

carriage of packaged goods in a container which is not structurally serviceable;

8.

tanks/tank containers (including ones that are empty and uncleaned) have not been closed properly;

9.

carriage of a combination packaging with an outer packaging which is not closed properly;

10.

incorrect labelling, marking or placarding;

11.

there are no instructions in writing conforming to the ADR, or the instructions in writing are not relevant to the goods carried;

12.

the vehicle is not properly supervised or parked.

3.

Risk Category III

Where failure to comply with relevant provisions result in a low level of risk of personal injury or damage to the environment and where appropriate corrective measures do not need to be taken at the roadside but can be addressed at a later date at the undertaking.

Failures are:

1.

the size of placards or labels or the size of letters, figures or symbols on placards or labels does not comply with the regulations;

2.

information in the transport documentation other than that in risk categoryÂ I/(16) is not available;

3.

the training certificate is not on board the vehicle but there is evidence that the driver holds it.
