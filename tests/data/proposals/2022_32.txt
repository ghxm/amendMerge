Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

establishing a framework of measures for strengthening Europe's semiconductor ecosystem (Chips Act)

(Text with EEA relevance)

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

•

Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

Semiconductor chips are central to the digital economy. They make digital products work: from smartphones and cars, to critical applications and infrastructures in health, energy, communications and automation to most other industry sectors. They are also key to the technologies of the future, including artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G/6G communication. There is no “digital” without chips.

Within the past year, Europe has witnessed disruptions in the supply of chips, causing shortages across multiple economic sectors and potentially serious societal consequences. Many European sectors, including automotive, energy, communication and health as well as strategic sectors such as defence, security, and space are under threat by such supply disruptions. At the same time, fake chips start appearing on the market, compromising the security of electronic devices and systems.

The current crisis has revealed structural vulnerabilities of the European value chains. The global semiconductor shortage has exposed European dependency on supply from a limited number of companies and geographies, and its vulnerability to third country export restrictions and other disruptions in the present geopolitical context. Furthermore, this dependency is exacerbated by the extremely high barriers to entry and capital intensity of the sector. For example, the most computationally powerful chips require manufacturing to a precision of a few

nanometres

(nm).

Building such facilities entails an upfront investment of at least EUR 15 billion

and requires three years to achieve production-readiness with adequate yields

. The expenditures to design such chips can range from EUR 0.5 billion to well over EUR 1.0 billion.

Research and development (

R&D

)

intensity in the sector is high and more than 15%.

Today, European players invest mainly in R&D, but not enough in translating its results into industrial benefits. Such R&D is a key enabler of miniaturisation in semiconductor technologies

required for the production of the next generation computationally powerful chips. Europe is home to world-leading research and technology organisations (RTOs). However, many results of European R&D are industrially deployed outside the Union.

The Union is strong in the design of semiconductor components for power electronics, radio frequency and analogue devices, sensors and microcontrollers that have a widespread use in the automotive and manufacturing industries today. It is less strong in the design of digital logic (processors and memory), which become essential as data, AI and connectivity become increasingly pervasive.

The Union is also very well positioned in terms of the materials and equipment needed to run large chip manufacturing plants, with many companies playing essential roles along the supply chain. It has strong and diversified industrial user sectors, e.g. automotive, industrial automation, healthcare, energy, communication, etc. However, collaboration along the value chain is weak.

The Union’s

overall global semiconductors market share is 10%

in value

, well below its economic weight. Despite its strong global position in materials and equipment manufacturing,

the Union

is heavily dependent on third-country suppliers for the design, manufacturing, packaging, testing and assembly of chips.

Today, semiconductors are at the centre of strong geostrategic interests and at the core of the global technological race. Countries are keen to secure their supply in the most advanced chips as it will condition their capacity to act (economically, industrially and militarily) and drive digital transformation. All major world regions are heavily investing and rolling out support measures to innovate and strengthen their production capabilities.

The Union

has the assets to become an industrial leader in the chips market of the future. Its

ambition is to double its world production share today to 20% in value by 2030

. The goal is not only to reduce dependencies, but also to seize the economic opportunities as the global market for semiconductors is expected to double before the end of the decade, increasing competitiveness of the semiconductor ecosystem, and of industry at large, through innovative products for European citizens.

New market trends and opportunities are emerging. Semiconductor companies increasingly co-design customised chips with end-user companies to improve system performance through hardware-software optimisation. AI, edge cloud and the digital transformation of industrial sectors offer new opportunities for future competitiveness of European technology and industry leadership.

At the same time, technology is constantly evolving. Further miniaturisation continues, towards smaller node dimensions in the mainstream process technologies (FinFET and FDSOI) along the lines of Moore’s law

, while more energy-efficient solutions are in high demand to ensure that the ever-growing processing footprint remains sustainable. Emerging computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic computing and quantum technologies are promising technologies for new application areas. New materials such as Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) are essential for power management, e.g. the optimal use of battery power, in particular for electric vehicles of all kinds and renewable energy generation.

This explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a

Regulation of the European Parliament and Council establishing a framework of measures for strengthening the semiconductor ecosystem

in the Union (Chips Act)

.

This proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen, who announced in her

2021 State of the Union speech that the aim is to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem, including production

. The proposal’s underlying strategic vision for strengthening Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem is explained in the accompanying Communication.

To fulfil this vision, t

he

European Chips Strategy

is articulated around five strategic objectives

:

·

Europe should strengthen its research and technology leadership;

·

Europe should build and reinforce its own

capacity

to innovate in the design, manufacturing and packaging of advanced chips, and turn them into

commercial

products;

·

Europe should put in place an adequate framework to increase substantially its production capacity by 2030;

·

Europe should address the acute skills shortage, attract new talent and support the emergence of a skilled workforce;

·

Europe should develop an in-depth understanding of global semiconductor supply chains.

The proposal aims at reaching the strategic objective of increasing the resilience of Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and increasing its global market share. It also aims at facilitating early adoption of new chips by European industry and increasing its competitiveness. For this, it needs to attract investment in innovative production facilities, have a skilled workforce, but also be in the position to design and produce the most advanced chips that will define the markets of tomorrow, develop capabilities and have the possibility to test and prototype innovative designs through pilot lines in close collaboration with its industrial vertical sectors. These are necessary steps, but not sufficient unless the Union has the analytical capability of increasing the knowledge of the policy makers of the value chain and is capable to benefit from increased capacity to serve the common interest of the single market in case of crisis. The objective is not to become self-sufficient, which is not an achievable target. We must strengthen our strengths, develop new strengths and work with third countries in a supply chain where interdependencies will remain strong.

In terms of delivering on these objectives, the proposal will aim to:

·

Set up the Chips for Europe

Initiative

, to support large-scale

technological

capacity building and innovation

throughout

the Union to enable the development

and deployment

of cutting-edge and next

generation semiconductor and quantum technologies that will reinforce the

Union’s

advanced design, systems integration, chips production capabilities

and skills

, including emphasis on start-ups and scale-ups (pillar 1, “Chips for Europe

Initiative

”).

In particular, the

Initiative

will build a

n innovative

virtual design platform to reinforce Europe’s design capacity, which will be

accessible on open, non-discriminatory and transparent terms

.

The platform will stimulate a wide cooperation of user communities with design houses,

start-ups

and SMEs

,

intellectual property (IP) and tool suppliers, designers and RTOs, and will int

egrate existing and new design facilities with extended libraries and EDA

tools.

The Initiative will support pilot lines that provide the means for third parties under open, transparent, and non-discriminatory terms to test, validate and further develop their product designs. The development of new advanced pilot lines will prepare for the next generation of production capabilities and their validation.

Furthermore, the Initiative will contribute to building advanced technology and engineering capacities for accelerating the innovative development of quantum chips, e.g. in the form of design libraries for quantum chips, pilot lines, and testing and experimentation facilities.

The Initiative will support a network of competence centres across the Union that will provide expertise to stakeholders, including end-user small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), start-ups as well as vertical sectors, and improve their skills. Competence centres will facilitate open, transparent, and non-discriminatory access to and effective use of the design infrastructure and the pilot lines. They will become poles of attraction for innovation and for new, highly skilled talent.

Additionally to the Initiative, activities to facilitate access to debt financing and equity in the semiconductor value chain, to be described collectively as the ‘Chips Fund’, should support the development of a dynamic and resilient semiconductor ecosystem by providing opportunities for increased availability of funds to support the growth of start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs as well as investments across the value chain, including for companies in the semiconductor value chains potentially with blending provided by the Initiative.

·

Create a framework to ensure security of supply

by attracting investments and enhanced production capacities in semiconductor manufacturing as well as advanced packaging, test, and assembly via first-of-a-kind Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries (pillar 2, “Security of supply”).

In particular, the proposal defines criteria for facilitating the implementation of specific projects that contribute to the security of supply of semiconductors in the Union. To this end, it distinguishes between two types of first-of-a-kind facilities

, namely Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries

. If an application by a facility to be recognised as one of the two types of first-of-a-kind facilities is successful, the proposal requires Member States to ensure efficient processing of administrative applications related to the planning, construction and operation of a recognised first-of-a-kind facility.

In response to increasing need for cyber-resilient supply chains

the Commission will work with Member States and private actors to identify sectorial requirements for trusted chips with a view to establishing common standards and certification, as well as common requirements for procurement

,

to be developed with the support of the European standardisation organisations where appropriate and bearing in mind the principles of the New Legislative Framework for conformity assessment and market surveillance

.

·

Set up a coordination mechanism between the Member States and the Commission

for strengthening collaboration with and across Member States, monitoring the supply of semiconductors, estimate demand, anticipate shortages, trigger

the activation of a crisis stage

and act through a dedicated toolbox of measures (pillar 3, “

Monitoring and Crisis Response

”).

•

Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area

This proposal is coherent with the Commission’s overall digital vision, targets, and avenues for a successful digital transformation of the European Union by 2030 as presented in the Commission Communication “The 2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade” (‘Digital Compass Communication’)

and the subsequent Commission’s proposal for the Digital Decade Policy Programme

, with

the

particular target on semiconductors. This proposal is intended to help equip the Union with the capabilities that will be needed to deliver on

its

2030 target.

This proposal is consistent with the Commission’s Communication updating the 2020 new industrial strategy

in May 2021 that identifies areas of strategic dependencies that could lead to vulnerabilities such as supply shortages. The proposal addresses the design, manufacturing, packaging, testing and assembly challenges identified in the Communication and accompanying staff working document. The Communication

announces the Industrial Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor technologies (Alliance)

to identify gaps in the production of microchips and the technology developments needed for companies and organisations to thrive, help the competitiveness of companies, increase Europe’s digital sovereignty, and address the demand for the next generation of secure, energy-efficient, powerful chips and processors. In the context of

this Regulation

, the Alliance will play an advisory role

.

This proposal is consistent also with the Commission’s standardisation strategy

and the 2022 Annual Union Work Programme for European standardisation

that were adopted on 2 February 2022. They envisage the development of

standards for the certification of chips in terms of security, authenticity and reliability.

This proposal also takes account of the objectives of the Observatory for Critical Technologies

, which aims to help identify the Union’s current and possible future digital strategic dependencies and contribute to strengthening its digital sovereignty.

This proposal addresses the sector-specific and unique challenges of the semiconductors supply chain and is a separate initiative from the planned “Single Market Emergency Instrument” that the Commission announced in its updated industrial strategy.

This proposal contributes to the implementation of the

Declaration on A European Initiative on Processors and semiconductor technologies, signed by 22 Member States on 7 December 2020.

In the declaration,

the 22

Member States agreed to “undertake particular efforts to reinforce the semiconductor ecosystem and to expand industrial presence across the supply chain.” Member States also agreed to

“work towards common standards and, where appropriate, certification for trusted electronics, as well as common requirements for procurement of secure chips and embedded systems in applications that rely on or make extensive use of chip technology.”

This proposal

is consistent with these objectives

.

Furthermore, the proposal is in line with the recent Communication “A competition policy fit for new challenges”, where the Commission acknowledges that it may “envisage approving public support to fill possible funding gaps in the semiconductor ecosystem for the establishment in particular of European first-of-a-kind facilities in the Union, based on Article 107(3) TFEU. Such aid would have to be subject to strong safeguards to ensure aid is necessary, appropriate and proportionate, undue competition distortions are minimised, and that benefits are shared widely and without discrimination across the European economy.”

The Chips for Europe Initiative will pool resources from the Union, Member States and third countries associated with the existing Union programmes, as well as the private sector.

The actions under the Chips for Europe

Initiative

will be primarily implemented through the Chips Joint Undertaking, i.e. the amended and renamed current Key Digital Technologies Joint Undertaking

. This Joint Undertaking currently provides extensive support for industrially driven research, technology development, and innovation in the area of electronic components and systems, and related software and systems technologies. These activities will become part of the Chips for Europe

Initiative

.

The Chips for Europe

Initiative

builds on and complements the

five specific objectives of the

Digital Europe

p

rogramme

(DEP)

, which support digital capacity building in key digital domains where semiconductor technology underpins performance gains,

including

High Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity, together with skills development and the deployment of digital innovation hubs. The Chips for Europe

Initiative

through new Specific Objective 6, which should have a thematic focus on semiconductor technologies,

will invest in capacity building to reinforce advanced research, design, production and systems integration capabilities in cutting-edge and next

generation semiconductor technologies.

The Chips for Europe

Initiative

also builds on and complements Horizon Europe

programme (HE)

, which in the area of semiconductors provides support for academically driven research, technology development and innovation. The

Initiative

will focus on supporting investment into cross-border and openly accessible research, development and innovation infrastructures set up in the Union to enable the development of semiconductor technologies across Europe. New semiconductor technologies from research and innovation actions supported by Horizon Europe may be progressively taken up and deployed by the capacity building parts of the Chips for Europe

Initiative

. Conversely, the technology capacities of the

Initiative

will be made available to the research and innovation community, including for actions supported through Horizon Europe.

This proposal

is provided in light of the opportunities offered by

the

InvestEU

programme

and

the significant contribution to digital transformation provided by

the Recovery and Resilience Facility

, for which at least 20% of funds must contribute to digital objectives

.

This proposal is also consistent with the Security Union Strategy

.

In order to accelerate the implementation of the actions, the Chips for Europe

Initiative

provides for a new legal instrument – the European Chips Infrastructure Consortium (ECIC) – that is specifically developed to simplify and structure the legal relationships between the private-public consortium members, including particularly

RTOs

, and provide a structural dialogue with the Commission for the implementation of the actions under the

Initiative

. This new legal instrument is voluntary and will complement the Union’s toolbox of various other legal instruments, including European Digital Infrastructure Consortium

15

, that allow to combine funding from Member States, the Union budget, and private investments. Legal entities, when forming a public-private consortium for the purpose of the implementing actions under the

Initiative

, will have a choice among the available Union’s legal instruments that better fits the specific purpose, composition and set-up of a particular consortium.

The Chips Joint

U

ndertaking entrusted with the overall implementation of the certain actions under this Initiative, may under the conditions provided in the Article 134

of the Commission’s Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EU) 2021/2085 establishing the Joint Undertakings under Horizon Europe, as regards the Chips Joint Undertaking

provide that certain actions may be carried out only by legal entities cooperating within a consortium that may be structured in a form of European Chips Infrastructure Consortium, or any other available Union legal instruments available for forming a consortium.

•

Consistency with other Union policies

The proposed measures

can support

some of the main policies of the Union, such as the Green Deal

. The application of semiconductor technologies, and digital technologies in general, are powerful enablers for the sustainability transition and can lead to new products and more efficient and effective ways of working that contribute to the Green Deal objectives.

Semiconductor supply disruptions and dependencies on other regions can slow down the sustainability transition of European sectors benefiting from digital solutions. To address the disruptions and dependencies, the proposal strengthens Europe’s semiconductor production capacity. Where applicable, facilities should be fully compliant with requirements stemming from Union legislation such as related to environmental impact assessment, emissions to air, water and soil, including the risk and prevention of industrial accidents, and seek to ensure high energy and resource and water efficiency. Strengthening the production capacity requires quick set-up of semiconductor manufacturing facilities, which may exceptionally be considered as being of overriding public interest where necessary for derogations in permit granting procedures, including in certain environmental assessments, provided that the remaining other conditions set out in the relevant provisions are fulfilled. At the same time, the first-of-a-kind concept includes possible qualification also based on the facility’s envisaged energy or environmental performance.

Digital technologies

, both when manufactured and used

have their own environmental footprint, including

from the release of fluorinated greenhouse gases during manufacturing to

their significant energy consumption

for their production and during their use

. The information and communications technology (ICT) sector is responsible for 5-9% of the world’s total electricity use and more than 2% of all emissions

. Data centres alone accounted for 2.7% of electricity demand in 2018 in the

Union

and will reach 3.21% by 2030, if development continues on the current trajectory

. Such energy consumption needs to be reduced. The proposal, and in particular the

setting up

design facilities and pilot lines under pillar 1, will lead to the design, testing and validation of new, low power processors. Processors are the core components of servers that handle the computational workload in data centres. Larger data centres contain millions of such servers and improvements in the power consumption of processors can have a significant bearing on the overall power consumption of a data centre. Such chips with a low-energy footprint contribute also to positioning the

Union

as a leader in sustainable digital technologies.

The proposal contributes to the objectives of parts of the Fit for 55 package that focus on promoting cleaner vehicles and fuels in a technologically neutral way

. The revision of the CO

2

emission standards for new cars and vans aims at further reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of these vehicles, providing a clear and realistic pathway towards zero-emission mobility. Consumer demand for zero emission vehicles, such as electrically chargeable vehicles, is increasing already

. Electrically chargeable vehicles typically have more than twice the amount of semiconductor content per vehicle than cars with internal-combustion engines

. Advanced packaging technologies are increasingly important to address increasing power and energy-efficiency requirements by electrical vehicles. It follows that

this is

consistent with the objectives of the Fit for 55 package.

The proposal is in line with the Circular Economy Action Plan

, which identifies electronics and ICT as a key value chain and announces a Circular Electronics Initiative to encompass “regulatory measures for electronics and ICT including mobile phones, tablets and laptops under the Ecodesign Directive so that devices are designed for energy efficiency and durability, reparability, upgradability, maintenance, reuse and recycling

”

.

Keeping electronic products in use for longer, through design for durability and upgrading services, will reduce replacement rates and the need for new products. Microchip materials can be recovered from electronic waste; it is, for instance, technically possible to recycle compound semiconductor materials, although currently only in very small quantities.

The Sustainable Product Initiative, based on expansion of the scope of the Ecodesign Directive, will provide a potential vehicle for such requirements. The Commission is also investigating various possibilities for take-back and sell-back schemes for consumer electronics, to boost the supply of functional used devices.

With digitalisation and electrification increasing, energy-efficient chips contribute to other policies as well, including policies on industrial manufacturing, transport and energy, e.g. the upcoming Digitalisation of Energy Action Plan

. The demand for semiconductor technologies is expected to double in a decade. More and more chips are embedded in robots and manufacturing machines, in industry and in agriculture, but also in transport vehicles and other devices.

Because the proposal aims at

smart use of chips and other digital technologies, and

production of

more energy-efficient chips,

it

is consistent with and contributes to several sectoral policies.

2.

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

•

Legal basis

This Regulation pursues two separate specific objectives, which form essential parts of its general objective to establish a coherent framework for strengthening the Union’s semiconductor ecosystem. The first specific objective of the Regulation, underlying pillar 1, is creating large innovation capacities and the adequate technological capabilities in the semiconductor industry to accelerate and adjust to innovation. In addition, underlying pillars 2 and 3, the Regulation aims to increase the Union’s resilience and security of supply in the field of semiconductor technologies by supporting and coordinating investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing (pillar 2) and enabling coordinated monitoring and crisis response (pillar 3).

The appropriate legal basis for the first objective are Articles 173(3), 182(1) and 183 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 173(3) provides that the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the European Economic and Social Committee, may decide on specific measures in support of actions taken in the Member States to secure the conditions necessary for the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the Union and ensure the adjustment of the industry to structural changes due to fast innovation cycles. This legal basis, with regard to most activities undertaken under the Initiative, is appropriate given that pillar 1 of this Regulation aims to accelerate the semiconductor production of the Union’s industry, reinforce sovereignty in the semiconductor supply chain, boost industrial capacities, facilitate the development of innovative start-ups and SMEs, and encourage new investments in innovation and technological development. In view of the broad nature of the Initiative, it is also based on the TFEU Title ‘Research and technological development and space’ (Articles 182(1) and 183).

The appropriate legal basis for the second objective, underlying pillars 2 and 3, is Article 114 TFEU. Pillars 2 and 3 of this proposal

aim to

create a

harmonised legal framework for increasing the Union’s resilience and security of supply. The

use of semiconductors is critical for multiple economic sectors and societal functions in the Union and therefore, a resilient supply is essential for the functioning of the internal market.

Thus, any supply disruption must be anticipated and addressed without delay

in order to preserve the stable functioning of strategic downstream sectors.

In light of the significant economic impact of the current

semiconductor

shortage, it is likely that

Member States initiate regulatory measures to address the structural

vulnerabilities

of the sector that have led to the current shortage

or to respond to

and mitigate

future

shortage

s

in crisis situations

.

While adequate with a view to addressing deficiencies at a national level, such regulatory measures could entail an incoherent response to the need to strengthen resilience and to address possible crises in the internal market, thereby leading

to fragmentation of the sector

.

With a view to enabl

ing

coordinated measures for

building resilience

,

harmonised

rules for facilitating the implementation of specific projects that contribute to the security of supply of semiconductors in the Union (pillar 2)

are necessary

.

The proposed monitoring and crisis response

mechanism

(pillar 3) should be uniform to enable a coordinated approach to crisis preparedness for the cross-border semiconductor value chain. The proposal provides for the appropriate governance structure and cooperation between

Member States

at Union level, hence supporting trust, innovation and growth in the internal market. Article 114 TFEU is therefore

a pertinent legal basis

for pillars 2 and 3 in order

to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.

Other articles of the TFEU or each article on its own cannot justify both of the above objectives. Article 122 TFEU is not pertinent, as it does not provide for a basis for both objectives and is not compatible with either of Articles 114 and 173 TFEU. The proposed elements are provided in one act, as all the measures constitute a coherent approach to address, in different ways, the need for strengthening of the Union’s semiconductor ecosystem.

•

Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)

The objectives of the proposal cannot be achieved by Member States acting alone, as the problems are of a cross-border nature, and not limited to single Member States or to a subset of Member States. The proposed actions focus on areas where there is a demonstrable value added in acting at Union level due to the scale, speed and scope of the efforts needed.

Providing a comprehensive response to the semiconductor crisis requires a rapid and coordinated joint action from a variety of stakeholders, and in cooperation with Member States. No single Member State is capable of achieving this alone. Moreover, given the complexity of the semiconductor ecosystem, the consequence of the Union’s structural dependencies and supply shortages are so far-reaching that intervention at the level of the Union is best placed to address such issues.

Action at Union level can clearly best drive European actors towards a common vision and implementation strategy. This is key to generate economies of scale and of scope and generate critical mass necessary for cutting-edge capacities, limiting, if not avoiding, fragmentation of efforts, subsidy races, and suboptimal national solutions.

Union action is needed in relation to the areas that this proposal addresses through its three pillars.

·

With regard to the first pillar (“Chips for Europe

Initiative

”), the

Initiative

will support

large scale technological capacity building and innovation thro

ugh

the

Union to enable the development

and deployment

of cutting-edge and next

generation semiconductor and quantum technologies and to address Europe’s chronic structural weaknesses in design and production. Member States set up a first ‘Important Project of Common European Interest’ (IPCEI) in 2018, supporting cross-border innovative projects across the microelectronics value chain, with a second IPCEI in this field being planned.

While such initiatives are of strategic importance for the sector,

a

t this stage it is

likely that

they

alone would

not sufficiently address the capacity building in the form of pilot lines and design infrastructures that need to be made widely available to

all interested

third parties across Europe

and which will also enable the U

nion to play a stronger role in a glob

al and interdepend

ent ecosystem

. Such large-scale facilities can only be delivered at Union level due to the scale of investments and know-how necessary.

·

Regarding the second pillar (“Security of supply”), actions aimed at accelerating investment in semiconductor manufacturing can only be adequately designed and implemented at Union level, given the

scale of the

investments needed and because such manufacturing facilities will, by definition, serve the full internal market, strengthen the whole ecosystem, and guarantee security of supply in crises.

·

In relation to the third pillar (“

Monitoring and Crisis Response

”), enhanced

Union

cooperation will ensure the necessary and comparable intelligence gathering. Together, Member States and Commission will be able to anticipate shortages

, activate the crisis stage in a situation of severe shortage and

put in place the necessary measures to address

such a crisis

in more effective ways than

through a patchwork of national measures

.

•

Proportionality

The proposal is designed to strengthen Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem via short-term preparedness and monitoring to increase transparency of semiconductor supply chains, mid-term security of supply actions to enhance semiconductor production capacity in Europe, and longer-term technology and innovation leadership actions to set up design and production facilities for advanced and emerging semiconductor technologies.

In this context, the proposal focuses on those parts of the semiconductor ecosystem that contribute most to the resilience of the Union’s supply chain. The focus on the semiconductor ecosystem itself, rather than the larger electronics components and systems domain, or application areas using semiconductors and/or electronics components and systems, is intended to limit actions to one of today’s most crucial pain points for the European economy and society at large.

The Chips for Europe Initiative in pillar 1 puts in place the mechanisms necessary for ensuring longer-term competitiveness and innovation capacity of European industry via research and design capabilities, pilot lines for testing and experimentation, capacities for quantum chips, competence centres, and a fund for start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs.

The security of supply actions to enhance the Union’s semiconductor production capacity in pillar 2 may recognise a certain facility as an Integrated Production Facility or as an Open EU Foundry. With such recognition, Member States are required to ensure permits for such facilities and foundries are granted through fast procedures.

The preparedness actions in pillar 3 are based on monitoring and information exchange by Member States and the Union to anticipate disruptions in the supply chain. In case of (anticipated) disruptions, coordinated measures may be taken to mitigate or prevent semiconductor shortages and other disruptions.

•

Choice of the instrument

The proposal takes the form of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. This is the most suitable legal instrument for pillar 1 of the proposal setting up the Chips for Europe Initiative, as only a Regulation, with its directly applicable legal provisions, can provide the necessary degree of uniformity needed for the establishment and operation of a Union Initiative aiming at supporting an industrial sector across the internal market. The choice of a Regulation as a legal instrument for pillar 2 is justified by the need for a uniform application of the new rules, in particular the definition of Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries, as well as a uniform procedure for their recognition and support. Additionally, a Regulation is the most suitable instrument for pillar 3, as this part should provide for a mechanism to anticipate and address serious disruptions of the supply of semiconductors in the Union. The mechanism does not require the transposition through national measures and is directly applicable.

RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

•

Stakeholder consultations

In her speech at the World Economic Forum in January 2022, President von der Leyen mentioned that “we will propose our European Chips Act in early February” and that “we have no time to lose”

. Leading economies are keen to secure their supply in the most advanced chips as this increasingly conditions their capacity to act (economically, industrially, militarily) and drives digital transformation. They are already heavily investing and rolling out support measures to innovate and strengthen their production capacities, or expect to do so soon

.

There are indications that

Union

companies and RTOs may be attracte

d

to

move to other regions

. International players are less likely to expand existing

facilities

or set up new production facilities in the

Union

without full clarity on investment conditions, possibilities for public support, public investments in skills, infrastructure, and advanced R&D, etc.

Given the urgent need to act, no impact assessment was carried out and no online public consultation was foreseen. The analysis and all supporting evidence will be set out in a staff working document published at the latest within three months of the proposal’s publication.

Nevertheless, ad-hoc workshops with industry stakeholders on specific topics related to pillar 1 indicated the need to consider facilities for upcoming technologies, such as photonics, neuromorphic computing, and quantum technologies, as well as new materials

. In addition, these workshops emphasised the need for due consideration of alternative instruction set architectures, such as RISC-V.

Furthermore, in the context of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking – the predecessor of the Key Digital Technologies Joint Undertaking – meetings with industry representatives and public authorities took place in summer 2021, where the Digital Compass objectives, the update of the industrial strategy, the Industrial alliance, and the European Chips Act were discussed.

Regular meetings with Member States took place monthly in 2021 to prepare the planned second IPCEI on Microelectronics. The Member States provided inputs for the definition and assessment of Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries in pillar 2, as well as for the definition of specific facilities under pillar 1.

A meeting with CEOs representing key stakeholders in the European semiconductor

sector

took place on 10 January 2022. Key takeaways from that meeting were:

the need to

build on European strengths, e.g. R&D and equipment manufacturing; clear support for pilot lines and design infrastructures; support for start-ups and scale-ups; the need to increase Europe’s manufacturing capacity for both mature and advanced technologies; and the need for a worldwide level playing field

.

There were also numerous meetings with representatives of CEOs on the need to strengthen the European semiconductors sector, following Commissioner Breton’s meetings with the CEOs of the main semiconductor players and RTOs. These provided inputs particularly to pillar 1.

The European Forum for Electronic Components and Systems (EFECS), in November 2021, with over 500 participants, provided a large platform for discussion on industrial needs. Further input was provided in meetings with industry associations and their members, such as SEMI, ESIA, and Digital Europe.

Moreover, long-standing and regular contacts with industry stakeholders, Member States, trade associations and user associations enabled the collection of a fair amount of information and feedback relevant to the proposal.

Many reports have been published since end-2019 on the semiconductor sector describing trends and providing facts and figures, and served to inform the proposal

.

•

Impact assessment

This proposal is not accompanied by a formal impact assessment. Considering the urgency as explained above, an impact assessment could not have been delivered in the timeframe available prior to the adoption of the proposal. The analysis and all supporting evidence will be set out in a staff working document published at the latest within three months of the proposal’s publication.

Fundamental rights

Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’) provides for the freedom to conduct a business. The measures under pillars 1 and 2 of this proposal create innovation capacity and foster the security of supply of semiconductors, which can reinforce the freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices. Nevertheless, some measures under pillar 3 needed to address serious disruptions to of the semiconductor supply in the Union may temporarily limit the freedom to conduct a business and the freedom of contract, protected by Article 16 and the right to property, protected by Article 17 of the Charter. Any limitation of those rights in this proposal will, in accordance with Article 52(1) of the Charter, be provided for by law, respect the essence of those rights and freedoms, and comply with the principle of proportionality.

The obligation to disclose specific information to the Commission, provided that certain conditions are met, respects the essence of and will not disproportionately affect the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16 of the Charter). Any information request serves the objective of general interest of the Union to enable the identification of potential mitigation measures to a semiconductor shortage crisis. These information requests are appropriate and effective to attain the objective by providing information necessary to assess the crisis at hand. The Commission in principle only requests the desired information from representative organisations and may issue requests to individual undertakings only if it is necessary in addition. Since information on the supply situation is not available otherwise, there is not any equally effective measure to attain the information necessary to enable European decision-makers to take mitigation action. In light of the serious economic and societal consequences of semiconductor shortages and the respective importance of mitigation measures, information requests are proportionate to the desired aim. Furthermore, the limitation to the freedom to conduct a business and the right to property are offset by appropriate safeguards. Any request to information may only be launched in a situation of crisis in which the Commission has activated the crisis stage through an implementing act.

The obligation to accept and prioritise priority rated orders respects the essence of and will not disproportionately affect the freedom to conduct a business and the freedom of contract (Article 16 of the Charter) and the right to property (Article 17 of the Charter). This obligation serves the objective of general interest of the Union to ensure critical sectors affected by supply disruptions on account of a semiconductor shortage continue to operate. The obligation is appropriate and effective to attain this objective by ensuring the available resources are preferentially utilised for products supplied to these sectors. There is no equally effective measure. It is proportionate to oblige in a situation of crisis semiconductor manufacturing facilities that have applied to be recognised as “Integrated Production Facilities” and “Open EU Foundries”, other semiconductor manufacturing facilities which have accepted such possibility in the context of receiving public support, or undertakings along the semiconductor supply chain which have been subjected to a priority rated order from a third country to the extent this impacts significantly the security of supply to critical sectors, to accept and prioritise certain orders. Appropriate safeguards ensure that any negative impact of the prioritisation obligation on the freedom to conduct a business, the freedom of contract and the right to property does not amount to a violation of these rights. Any obligation to prioritise certain orders may only be launched in a situation of crisis in which the Commission has activated the crisis stage through an implementing act. The undertaking concerned may request the Commission to review the priority rated order if it is unable to perform the order or performing the order would place unreasonable economic burden on them and entail particular hardship. Furthermore, the subject of the obligation is exempt from any liability for damages for the violation of contractual obligations resulting from compliance with the obligation.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

The proposal establishes the Chips for Europe Initiative, which will not have a separate financial envelope, but will be supported by funding from the HE, and the DEP, to be enlarged by a new Specific Objective 6. The Regulation 2021/2085 establishing the Joint Undertakings under HE is amended and expanded to allow the Key Digital Technologies Undertaking, renamed as a Chips Joint Undertaking (Chips JU) to implement the increased contribution from HE and contributions from DEP under the Specific Objective 6. The financial consequences of the proposal on the Union budget are presented in the financial statement accompanying the proposal and will be met from the available resources of the Multiannual financial framework 2021-2027.

The EU budget will support the Chips for Europe Initiative with a total of up to EUR 3.3 billion, including EUR 1.65 billion via HE and EUR 1.65 billion via DEP. Out of this total amount, EUR 2.875 billion will be implemented through the Chips Joint Undertaking, EUR 125 million through InvestEU (to be complemented with other by 125 million under InvestEU itself) and EUR 300 million through the EIC. This comes in addition to the budget already dedicated to activities in microelectronics under this MFF to reach almost 5 billion.

In particular, an amount of up to EUR

1.65

billion

will be implemented under HE in favour of the Chips for Europe Initiative: EUR 900 million under Cluster 4

EUR 150 million from Cluster 3, EUR 300 million from Cluster 5

and EUR 300 million under the European Innovation Council (EIC). In addition, the Commission proposes to reduce the budget of HE by an amount of EUR

400

million

to increase the amounts available for DEP. In order to compensate for this reduction of EUR

400

million

, the Commission proposes to make available again, for the benefit of the

HE

programme, a further amount of

EUR

400

million

(in current prices) of commitment appropriations over the period 2023-2027, resulting from total or partial non-implementation of projects belonging to that programme or its predecessor. This amount will be in addition to the EUR 0.5 billion (in 2018 prices) already mentioned in the Joint Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the re-use of decommitted funds in relation to the research programme

. The Commission therefore invites the European Parliament and Council to supplement this Joint Declaration with a mention of the additional amount to make available again.

OTHER ELEMENTS

•

Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements

The Commission will evaluate the output, results and impact of this proposal three years after the date on which it becomes applicable and every four years thereafter. The main findings of the evaluation will be presented in a report to the European Parliament and the Council, which will be made public. In order to conduct the evaluation, the European Semiconductor Board, the Member States and national competent authorities will provide information to the Commission on its request.

Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal

1.1.

Chapter I – General Provisions

Chapter I

lays out the subject matter of the Regulation. It also sets out the definitions used throughout the instrument. The Regulation establishes a framework, consisting of three “pillars”, for strengthening Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem. In particular, the Regulation establishes the Chips for Europe Initiative that creates the conditions necessary to strengthen the Union’s industrial innovation capacity (pillar 1), includes the definition and criteria of first-of-a-kind Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries (pillar 2) and a coordination mechanism for monitoring and crisis response (pillar 3).

1.2.

Chapter II – Chips for Europe

Initiative

Chapter II

sets up the Chips for Europe Initiative that will reinforce the Union’s competitiveness, resilience and innovation capacity. Through investments into the Chips for Europe Initiative, the Union should increase its effectiveness in turning its research and technology developments into demand-oriented, application-driven, secure and energy-efficient semiconductor technologies of the highest quality. At the same time, the Union should provide an opportunity for its supply industry to leverage on such investments.

To this end, this Chapter includes the general provisions and objectives of the Chips for Europe Initiative. The Initiative aims to support large-scale capacity building throughout the Union in existing and cutting-edge and next generation semiconductor technologies. The Initiative comprises five components: design capacities for integrated semiconductor technologies, pilot lines for preparing innovative production, and testing and experimentation facilities, advanced technology and engineering capacities for accelerating the development of quantum chips, a network of Competence Centres and skills development and the ‘Chips Fund’ activities for access to capital by start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs.

The Initiative shall be supported by funding from HE and DEP, and in particular its new Specific Objective 6 thereof, and implemented in accordance with the Regulations establishing those programmes.

The Regulation provides for a procedural framework to facilitate combined funding from Member States, investment without prejudice with State aid rules, the Union budget and private investment. This will take the form of a new instrument with legal personality, the European Chips Infrastructure Consortium (‘ECIC’), which can be used by legal entities to structure their collaborative work within a consortium, on a voluntary basis. In addition, Section 1 sets up a mechanism for establishing a European network of Competence Centres for the purpose of implementing actions on competence centres and skills under the Chips for Europe Initiative.

The Chapter also includes provisions on the implementation. The primary implementation of the Initiative will be entrusted to the Chips Joint Undertaking as proposed in the Commission’s Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EU) 2021/2085 . The technical description of the actions is provided in Annex I. Annex II includes measurable indicators to monitor the implementation and to report on the progress of the Initiative towards the achievement of its objectives. The Commission is enabled to adopt delegated acts to amend the list of measurable indicators. The Initiative builds on Europe’s existing strengths in the global semiconductor value chain and enhances synergies with actions currently supported by the Union and Member States. Therefore, in order to maximise its positive impacts, the Initiative should enable synergies with Union programmes described in Annex III.

1.3.

Chapter III – Security of Supply

Chapter III

sets out the framework for Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries. Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries are manufacturing facilities providing semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that are “first-of-a-kind” in the Union and contribute to the security of supply and to a resilient ecosystem in the internal market. In particular, in order to qualify as Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries, the facility should have a clear positive impact on the semiconductor value chain in the Union.

While Integrated Production Facilities are vertically integrated production facilities, Open EU Foundries offer a significant degree of their production capacity to other industrial players, such as fabless semiconductor companies (i.e. companies that design but do not manufacture chips). Investment in these facilities facilitates the development of semiconductor manufacturing in the Union. Hence, upon recognition as an Integrated Production Facility or Open EU Foundry by the Commission, these facilities shall be considered to contribute to the security of supply of semiconductors in the Union and therefore in the public interest. In order to reach security of supply, Member States may, without prejudice to State aid rules, apply support schemes and shall provide for administrative support, including fast tracking of administrative application procedures related to their planning, construction and operation. The Commission will recognise a facility as an Integrated Production Facilities or Open EU Foundries if they fulfil the criteria set out in this Chapter. The Commission may repeal its decision if the recognition was based on incorrect information or the facility no longer fulfils the criteria.

1.4.

Chapter IV –

Monitoring and Crisis Response

Chapter IV

contains a mechanism for coordinated monitoring of the semiconductor value chain and responding to disruptions of the supply of semiconductors that have an impact on the proper functioning of the internal market.

Section 1

(Monitoring) sets out a monitoring and alerting system of the semiconductor value chain. The system is based on regular monitoring activities of Member States consisting of, in particular, the observation of early warning indicators and the availability and integrity of the services and goods provided by key market actors. The Commission provides the basis for the monitoring activities through a Union risk assessment in which it identifies the early warning indicators. To ensure industry participation, the Member States will invite relevant stakeholders and industry associations to inform about significant fluctuations in demand and disruptions of their supply chain. Member States should provide regular updates and exchange their findings in the European Semiconductor Board. If Member States become aware of a potential semiconductor crisis or the occurrence of a relevant risk factor in the frame of their monitoring activities or through an update from stakeholders, they shall alert the Commission. Upon this alert, or upon an alert through other sources including information from international partners, the Commission shall convene an extraordinary meeting of the European Semiconductor Board. The meeting will serve to assess the need to activate the crisis stage and discuss potential coordinated procurement ahead of a shortage. Furthermore, the Commission shall enter into consultations or cooperation, on behalf of the Union, with relevant third countries with a view to seeking cooperative solutions to address supply chain disruptions.

Section 2

(Crisis Stage) provides the rules to activate the semiconductor crisis stage and details the emergency measures that can be used to respond to the crisis.

The Commission is enabled to activate the crisis stage by means of an implementing act when there is concrete, serious, and reliable evidence of a semiconductor crisis. Such a semiconductor crisis occurs when there are serious disruptions in the supply of semiconductors leading to significant shortages, which involve significant negative effects on one or more important sectors of the Union, or prevent the supply, repair and maintenance of essential products used by critical sectors. The implementing act will specify the duration of the crisis stage or its prolongation. Before the expiry of the crisis stage, the Commission shall assess, taking into account the opinion of the European Semiconductor Board, whether the activation of the crisis stage should be prolonged. During the crisis stage, the European Semiconductor Board will hold extraordinary meetings to allow for Member States to work closely with the Commission and coordinate any national measures taken with regard to the semiconductor supply chain.

When the crisis stage is activated, the Commission may take certain emergency measures set out in this Regulation. The Commission may request representative organisations o

f undertakings, or, if need be

, individual undertakings operating along the semiconductor supply chain for information necessary for assessing the semiconductor crisis and identifying potential mitigation measures. These entities are obliged to provide the Commission with the requested information. The requested information can consist of information regarding their production capabilities, production capacities, current primary disruptions or any other existing data necessary to assess the nature of the semiconductor crisis or to identify and assess potential mitigation or emergency measures at national or Union level. Where appropriate, the Commission may oblige IPFs, OEFs

, semiconductor manufacturing

facilities which have previously

accepted this possibility in the context of receiving public support

, or undertakings along the semiconductor supply chain which have been subjected to a priority rated order request from a third country to an extent that significantly impacts the

operation of

critical sectors,

to accept and prioritise the production of crisis-relevant products for critical sectors. Additionally or alternatively, upon the request of two or more Member States, the Commission may, on their behalf, act as a central purchasing body in order to procure crisis-relevant products for critical sectors. The Commission will, in consultation with the European Semiconductor Board, assess the utility, necessity and proportionality of the request. For the definition of critical sectors, this Regulation refers to the

sectors enlisted in

Annex of

the Commission proposal for a

Directive

of the European Parliament and of the Council

on the resilience of critical entities

, and additionally the defence sector

and other activities that are relevant for public safety and security

, and provides that the Commission may limit these emergency measures to certain sectors within this list

.

1.5.

Chapter V – Governance

Chapter V

sets up the governance systems at Union and national level. At Union level, the proposal establishes a European Semiconductor Board, composed of representatives from the Member States and chaired by the Commission. The European Semiconductor Board will provide advice on the Initiative to the Public Authorities Board of the Chips Joint Undertaking (pillar 1); provide advice and assistance to the Commission in order to exchange information on the functioning of the IPF and OEF (pillar 2); discuss and prepare the identification of specific critical sectors and technologies, address monitoring and crisis response issues (pillar 3), and to provide support in the consistent application of the proposed Regulation and facilitate cooperation among Member States. The European Semiconductor Board shall support the Commission in international cooperation. It shall also coordinate and exchange information with relevant crisis structures established under Union law. The European Semiconductor Board will meet in different compositions and hold separate meetings for its tasks under pillar 1 and for its tasks under pillars 2 and 3. The Commission may establish standing or temporary sub-groups of the European Semiconductor Board and invite organisations representing the interests of the semiconductor industry and other stakeholders to such sub-groups as observers.

At national level, Member States will designate one or more national competent authorities and, among them, a national single point of contact for the purpose of implementing the Regulation.

1.6.

Chapter VI, VII, VIII – Final Provisions

Chapter VI

emphasizes the obligation of all parties to respect the confidentiality of sensitive business information and trade secrets. The obligation applies to the Commission, the national competent authorities and other authorities of the Member States, as well as all representatives and experts attending meetings of the European Semiconductor Board and the Committee. The Chapter also establishes rules on effective, proportionate, and dissuasive penalties and fines for noncompliance with the obligations under this Regulation, subject to appropriate safeguards. The Commission may impose periodic penalty payments for failure of the relevant undertakings to accept and prioritise certain orders in a semiconductor crisis. Furthermore, the Commission may impose fines on an undertaking that provides incorrect, incomplete or misleading information, or does not supply the information within the prescribed time limit.

Chapter VII

sets out rules and conditions for the exercise of delegation and implementing powers. The proposal empowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate, implementing acts to allow for procedural specification and ensure uniform application of the Regulation and delegated acts to amend Annex I (the activities set out therein in a manner consistent with the objectives of the Initiative) and Annex II (the measurable indicators and the provisions on the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework to supplement this Regulation).

Chapter VIII

contains amendments to other acts, including the Digital Europe programme, and an obligation for the Commission to prepare regular reports for the evaluation and review of the Regulation to the European Parliament and to the Council.

2022/0032 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

establishing a framework of measures for strengthening Europe's semiconductor ecosystem (Chips Act)

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular

Articles

173(3), 182(1), 183 and 114 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

,

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)

Semiconductors are at the core of any digital device: from smartphones and cars, through critical applications and infrastructures in health, energy, communications and automation to most other industry sectors. While semiconductors are essential to the functioning of our modern economy and society, the Union has witnessed unprecedented disruptions in their supply. The current supply shortage is a symptom of permanent and serious structural deficiencies in the

Union’s

semiconductor value and supply chain. The disruptions have exposed long-lasting vulnerabilities in this respect, notably a strong third-country dependency in manufacturing and design of chips.

(2)

A

framework for increasing the Union’s resilience in the field of semiconductor technologies

should be established

, stimulating investment, strengthening the capabilities of the

Union’s

semiconductor supply chain, and increasing cooperation among the Member States and the Commission.

(3)

This framework

pursues two objectives

.

Th

e

first objective

is to ensure the conditions necessary for the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the Union and to ensure the adjustment of the industry to structural changes due to fast innovation cycles

and the need for sustainability

. The second objective, separate and complementary to the first one,

is to

improv

e

the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform Union legal framework for increasing the Union’s resilience and security of supply in the field of semiconductor technologies.

(4)

It is necessary to

take measures to build capacity and strengthen the Union’s semiconductor

sector

in line with Article 173(3) of the Treaty. These measures do not entail the harmonisation of national laws and regulations. In this regard, the Union should reinforce the competitiveness and resilience of the semiconductor technological and industrial base, whilst strengthening the innovation capacity of its semiconductor

sector

, reducing dependence on a limited number of third country companies and geographies, and strengthening its capacity to design and produce advanced components. The Chips for Europe

Initiative

(the ‘

Initiative

’) should support these aims by bridging the gap between Europe’s advanced research and innovation capabilities and their

sustainable

industrial exploitation. It should promote capacity building to enable design, production and systems integration in next

generation semiconductor technologies, enhance collaboration among key players across the Union, strengthening Europe's semiconductor supply and value chains, serving key industrial sectors and creating new markets.

(5)

The use of semiconductors is critical for multiple economic sectors and societal functions in the Union and therefore, a resilient supply is essential for the functioning of the internal market.

Given the wide circulation of semiconductor products across borders, the

resilience and security of supply of semiconductors

can be best addressed through Union harmonising legislation

based on Article 114 of the Treaty

.

With a view to enabling coordinated measures for building resilience, harmonised rules for facilitating the implementation of specific projects that contribute to the security of supply of semiconductors in the Union are necessary. The proposed monitoring and crisis response mechanism should be uniform to enable a coordinated approach to crisis preparedness for the cross-border semiconductor value chain.

(6)

The achievement of these objectives will be supported by a governance mechanism. At Union level, this Regulation establishes a European Semiconductor Board, composed of representatives of the Member States and

chaired by

the Commission. The European Semiconductor Board will provide advice to and assist the Commission on specific questions, including the consistent application of this Regulation, facilitating cooperation among Member States and exchanging information on issues relating to this Regulation

.

The European Semiconductor Board should hold separate meetings for its tasks

under the different chapters of this Regulation

. The different meetings may include different compositions of the high-level representatives and

the Commission

may

establish

subgroups

.

(7)

G

iven the

globalised nature of the

semiconductor supply chain, international cooperation with third countries is an

important

element

to achieve a resilience of the Union’s semiconductor ecosystem

.

The actions taken under this Regulation should also enable the Union to play a stronger role, as a centre of excellence, in a better functioning global, interdependent semiconductors ecosystem.

T

he

Commission, assisted by the

European Semiconductor Board

,

s

hould cooperate

and build partnerships

with third countries with a view to seeking solutions to address

, to the extent possible,

disruptions of the semiconductor supply chain.

(8)

The semiconductor sector is characterised by very high development and innovation costs and very high costs for building state of the art testing and experimentation facilities to support the industrial production. This has direct impact on the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the Union industry, as well as on the security and resilience of the supply. In light of the lessons learnt from recent shortages in the Union and worldwide and the rapid evolution of technology challenges and innovation cycles affecting the semiconductor value chain, it is necessary to strengthen the Union’s competitiveness, resilience and innovation capacity by setting up the

Initiative

.

(9)

Member States are primarily responsible for sustaining a strong Union industrial, competitive

, sustainable

and innovative base. However, the nature and scale of the innovation challenge in the semiconductor sector requires action to be taken collaboratively at Union level.

(10)

The

Horizon Europe Framework programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(Horizon Europe)

– the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, has the objective to strengthen the European research area (ERA), encouraging it to become more competitive, including in its industry, while promoting all research and innovation (R&I) activities to deliver on the Union's strategic priorities and commitments, which ultimately aim to promote peace, the Union's values and the well-being of its peoples. As a major priority of the Union, the total financial resources allocated to the programme should not be reduced and the reduction of the financial resources of the programme, aimed to reinforce the financial envelope of the Digital Europe programme with the aim of contributing to the Chips initiative, should be compensated by another source. Consequently, without prejudice to the institutional prerogatives of the European Parliament and of the Council, an amount of commitment appropriations equivalent to the reduction should be made available to Horizon Europe over the period 2023-2027, resulting from total or partial non-implementation of projects belonging to that programme or its predecessor, as provided for in Article 15

(3) of

Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(the Financial Regulation)

. This amount will be in addition to the EUR 0.5 billion (in 2018 prices) already mentioned in the Joint Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the re-use of decommitted funds in relation to the research programme.

(11)

In order to equip the Union with the semiconductor technology research and innovation capacities needed to maintain its research and industrial investments at a leading edge, and bridge the current gap between research and development and manufacturing, the Union and its Member States should better coordinate their efforts and co-invest.

T

o achieve this

, the Union and Member States, should take into consideration

the tw

in digital and green transition goals

. The

Initiative

throughout all components and actions,

to the extent possible

, should mainstream and

maximise the benefits of

application of semiconductor technologies

as

powerful enablers for the sustainability transition

that can

lead to new products and more efficient

,

effective

, clean and durable

use

of

resources, including energy and materials

necessary for production

and the whole lifecycle use of semiconductors

.

(12)

In order to achieve its

general

objective, and address both the supply and demand side challenges of the current semiconductor ecosystem, the

Initiative

should include five main components. First, to reinforce Europe’s design capacity, the

Initiative

should support actions to build a virtual platform that is

available

across the Union. The platform should connect the communities of design houses,

SMEs and start-ups,

intellectual property and tool suppliers, with research and technology organi

s

ations to provide virtual prototype solutions based on co-development of technology. Second, in order to strengthen the security and resilience of supply and reducing the Union’s dependency on third country production, the

Initiative

should support development and access to pilot lines. The pilot lines should provide for the industry a facility to test, experiment and validate semiconductor technologies and system design concepts at the higher technology readiness levels beyond level 3 but under level 8

while reducing environmental impacts as much as possible

. Union investments

along

Member States

investment

and with the private sector in pilot lines is necessary to address the existing structural challenge and market failure where such facilities are not available in

the Union

hindering innovation potential and global competitiveness of the Union. Third, in order to enable investments in alternative technologies, such as quantum

technologies

, conducive to the development of the semiconductors sector, the

Initiative

should support actions including on design libraries for quantum chips, pilot lines for building quantum chips and testing and experimentation facilities for quantum components. Fourth, in order to promote the use of the semiconductor technologies, to provide access to design and pilot line facilities, and to address skills gaps across the Union, the

Initiative

should support establishment of the competence centres on semiconductors in each Member State. Access to publicly funded infrastructure

, such as pilot and testing facilities,

and

to

the

competence network

,

should be open to

a wide range of

users and must be granted on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis and on market terms (or cost plus reasonable margin basis) for large undertakings, while SMEs can benefit from preferential access or reduced prices.

Such access, including for international research and commercial partners, can lead to broader cross-fertilisation and gains in know-how and excellence, while contributing to cost recovery.

Fifth, The Commission should set-up a dedicated semiconductor investment facility

support

(

as part of the investment facilitation activities described collectively as the

‘Chips Fund’) proposing both equity and debt solutions,

including a blending facility under the

InvestEU

Fund

established by Regulation (EU) 2021/523 of the European Parliament and Council

,

in close cooperation with the European Investment Bank Group

and together with other implementing partners such as national promotional banks and institutions

. The

‘

Chips Fund

’

activities

should support the development of a dynamic and resilient semiconductor ecosystem by providing opportunities for increased availability of funds to support the growth of start-ups and SMEs as well as investments across the value chain, including for

other companies in the semiconductor value chains

.

In this context, t

he European Innovation Council will provide further

dedicated

support through grants and equity investments to high risk, market creating innovators.

(13)

In order to overcome the limitations of the current fragmented public and private investments efforts, facilitate integration, cross-fertilisation, and return on investment on the ongoing programme

s

and to p

ursu

e

a common strategic Union vision on semiconductors

as a means to

realising the ambition of the Union and of its Member States to ensure a leading role in the digital economy

, the Chips for Europe Initiative should facilitate

better coordination and closer synergies between the existing funding programmes at Union and national levels, better coordination and collaboration with industry and key private sector stakeholders and additional

joint

investments

with Member States

. The implementation set up of the

Initiative

is built t

o pool resources from the Union

, Member States and third countries associated with the existing Union Programmes, as well as the private sector.

The

success of the

Initiative can therefore only be built on a collective effort by Member States, with the Union, to support both the significant capital costs and the wide availability of virtual design, testing and piloting resources and diffusion of knowledge, skills and competences.

Where appropriate, in view of

the specificities of the actions concerned, the objectives of the

Initiative

, specifically the

‘

Chips Fund

’

activities

, should also be supported

through

a

blending

facility

under the InvestEU Fund.

(14)

Support from the

Initiative

should be used to address market failures or sub-optimal investment situations in a proportionate manner, and actions should not duplicate or crowd out private financing or distort competition in the internal market. Actions should have a clear added value for the Union.

(15)

The

Initiative

should build upon the strong knowledge base and enhance synergies with actions currently supported by the Union and Member States through programmes and actions in research and innovation in semiconductors and in developments of part of the supply chain, in particular Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe

p

rogramme

established by Regulation (EU) 2021/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council

with the aim by 2030, to reinforce

the Union

as global player in semiconductor technology and its applications, with a growing global share in manufacturing. Complementing those activities, the

Initiative

would closely collaborate with

other relevant stakeholders, including with

the Industrial Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor Technologies.

(16)

With a view to accelerating implementation of the actions of the

Initiative

, it is necessary to provide an option of implementing some of the

Initiative

actions, in particular on pilot lines, through a new legal instrument, the European Chips Infrastructure Consortium (ECIC).

The

ECIC should have legal personality. This means that when applying for the actions to be funded by the

Initiative

, the ECIC itself, and not individual entities forming the ECIC, can be the applicant.

The main aim of the ECIC

should be

to encourage effective and structural collaboration between legal entities, including Research and Technology Organizations. For this reason,

the

ECIC

has to

involve the participation of at least three legal entities from

three

Member States and be operated as a public-private sector consortium for a specific action.

The setting up of ECIC

should not involve the actual setting up of a new Union body and should not be targeted at one specific action under the

Initiative

. It should address the gap in the Union’s toolbox to combine funding from Member States, the Union budget and private investment for the purposes of implementing actions of the

Initiative

.

In particular, strong synergies can be attained through combined development of the different pilot lines in an ECIC, pooling the Union’s contribution with the collective resources of the Member States and other participants.

The budget of the ECIC that would be made available by Member States and private sector participants over its projected period of operation should respect the timeframes of the actions implemented under this Initiative.

The Commission should not be directly a party in the Consortium.

(17)

The primary implementation of the

Initiative

should be entrusted to the Chips Joint Undertaking as

established by

Council Regulation

XX/XX

amending Regulation (EU) 2021/2085 establishing the Joint Undertakings under Horizon Europe, as regards the Chips Joint Undertaking

.

(18)

In order to encourage the establishment of the necessary manufacturing and related design capabilities, and thereby ensure the security of supply in the Union, public support may be appropriate. In that respect, it is necessary to set out the criteria for facilitating the implementation of specific projects that contribute to achieving the objectives of this Regulation and distinguish between two types of facilities, namely: Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries.

(19)

Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries should provide semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that are “first-of-a-kind” in the Union and contribute to the security of supply and to a resilient ecosystem in the internal market. The qualifying factor for the production of a first-of-a-kind facility could be with regard to the technology node,

substrate material, such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride,

and

other product innovation that can offer better performance,

process technology or energy and environmental performance. A facility of a comparable capability on an industrial scale should not yet substantively be present or committed to be built within the Union, excluding facilities for research and development or small-scale production sites.

(20)

Where

an Open EU Foundry

offers production capacity to undertakings not related to the operator of the facility, the Open EU Foundry should establish, implement and maintain adequate and effective functional separation in order to prevent the exchange of confidential information between internal and external production. This should apply to any information gained in the design and in the front-end or back-end manufacturing processes.

(21)

In order to qualify as Integrated Production Facilities or Open EU Foundries, the

establishment and operation of the

facility should have a clear positive impact on the

semiconductor value chain in the Union, in particular with regard to providing a resilient supply of semiconductors to users on the internal market. The impact on several Member States

, including cohesion

objectives

,

should

be considered as one of the indicators of a clear positive impact of an Integrated Production Facility and Open EU Foundry on the semiconductor value chain in the Union.

(22)

It is important that Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries are not subject to extraterritorial application of public service obligations

imposed

by third countries that could undermine their ability to use their infrastructure, software, services, facilities, assets, resources, intellectual property or knowhow needed to fulfil the obligation on priority rated orders under this Regulation

, which they would have to guarantee

.

(23)

In light of the fast development of semiconductor technologies and to strengthen the future industrial competitiveness of the Union, Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries should commit to continued and efficient investment into the next generations of

semiconductors

, including by testing and experimenting new developments through priority access to the pilot lines set up by the Chips for Europe

Initiative

,

without prejudice to effective access by others

.

(24)

To allow for a uniform and transparent procedure to attain recognition as an Integrated Production Facilit

y

and Open EU Foundr

y

, the recognition decision should be adopted by the Commission

following the application by an

individual undertaking or a consortium of several undertakings. To account for the importance of a coordinated and cooperated implementation of the planned facility, the Commission should take into account in its assessment the

readiness

of the Member State or Member States where the applicant intends to establish its facilities to support the set-up.

Furthermore, when

assessing the viability of the business plan, the Commission could take into account the overall record of the applicant.

In light of the privileges attached to recognition as an Integrated Production Facility or Open EU Foundry, the Commission should monitor whether facilities that have been granted this status continue to comply with the criteria set out in this Regulation.

(25)

In light of their importance for ensuring the security of supply and enabling a resilient semiconductor ecosystem, Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries should be considered to be in the public interest. Ensuring the security of supply of semiconductors is important also for digitalisation that enables the green transition of many other sectors. To contribute towards security of supply of semiconductors in the Union, Member States may apply support schemes and provide for administrative support in national permit granting procedures. This is without prejudice to the

c

ompe

tence

of the Commission

in the field of

S

tate aid

under Article 107 and 108

of the Treaty

, where relevant

. Member States should support the set-up of Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries in accordance with Union law

.

(26)

It is necessary that

Integrated Production F

acilities and Open EU Foundries

are

set-up as quickly as possible, while keeping the administrative burden to a minimum.

For that reason

, Member States should treat applications related to the planning, construction and operation of Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries in the most rapid manner possible.

They should

appoint

a

n

authority which will facilitate and coordinate the permit granting processes and appoint a coordinator, serving as a single point of contact

for the project

.

Moreover,

where nece

ssary for granting a derogation

under Council Directive 92/43/EEC

and Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and Council

,

the establishment and operation of these

facilities

may

be considered as being of overriding public interest within the meaning of the aforementioned legal texts

, provided that the remaining other conditions set out in these provisions are fulfilled

.

(27)

The internal market would greatly benefit from common standards for green, trusted and secure chips. Future smart devices, systems and connectivity platforms will have to rely on advanced semiconductor components and they will have to meet green, trust and cybersecurity requirements which will largely depend on the features of the underlying technology. To that end, the Union

should

develop

reference certification procedures

and require the industry to jointly develop

such

procedures for specific sectors and technologies with potential high social impact.

(28)

In light of this, the Commission, in consultation with the European Semiconductor Board, should prepare the ground for a certification of green, trusted and secure chips and embedded systems that rely on or make extensive use of semiconductor technologies. In particular, they should discuss and identify the relevant sectors and products in need of such certification.

(29)

In light of the structural deficiencies of the semiconductor supply chain and the resulting risk of future shortages, this Regulation provides instruments for a coordinated approach to monitoring and effectively tackling possible market disruptions.

(30)

Due to the complex, quickly evolving and interlinked semiconductor value chains with various actors, a coordinated approach to regular monitoring is necessary to increase the ability to mitigate risks that may negatively affect the supply of semiconductors. Member States should monitor the semiconductor value chain focusing on

early warning indicators and the availability and integrity of the services and goods

provided by

key market actors

, in such a way that it would not represent an excessive administrative burden for undertakings

.

(31)

Any relevant findings, including information provided by relevant stakeholders and industry associations, should be provided to the European Semiconductor Board to allow for a regular exchange of information between

high-level representatives

of Member States

and for integration of the information into a monitoring overview of the semiconductor value chains

.

(32)

It is important to take into account the specific insights into the supply situation of users of semiconductors. Therefore, Member States should identify and regularly exchange with the main user categories on their national markets. Furthermore, Member States should offer the possibility for relevant stakeholder organisations, including industry associations and representatives of the main user categories, to provide information regarding

significant

changes in demand and supply, and known disruptions of their supply chain,

this could

includ

e

the unavailability of critical semiconductors or raw materials, longer than average lead-time, delays in delivery and exceptional pri

ce surges.

(33)

In order to carry out these monitoring activities, the competent authorities of Member States may need certain information, which may not be publicly accessible, such as information on the role of an individual undertaking along the semiconductor value chain. In th

ose

limited circumstances in which it is necessary and proportionate for the purpose of carrying out the monitoring activities, the competent authorities of Member States

should be able to

request this information from the undertaking in question.

(34)

Member States should alert the Commission if relevant factors indicate a potential semiconductor crisis. In order to ensure a coordinated response to address such crises, the Commission should upon the alert by a Member State or through other sources, including information from international partners, convene an extraordinary meeting of the European Semiconductor Board for assessing the need to activate the crisis stage and for discussing whether it may be appropriate, necessary and proportionate for Member States to carry out coordinated joint procurement

.

The Commission

should

engage in consultations and cooperation with relevant third countries with a view to addressing any disruptions in the international supply chain, in compliance with international obligations and without prejudice to procedural requirements under the Treaty on international agreements.

(35)

As part of the monitoring, national competent authorities should also do a mapping of undertakings operating

in the

Union

along the semiconductor supply chain

established

in their national territory and notify this information to the Commission.

(36)

In order to facilitate effective monitoring, in-depth assessment of the risks associated with different stages of the semiconductor

value

chain is needed, including on the origins and sources of supplies beyond the Union. Such risks may be related to critical inputs and equipment for the industry, including digital products that may be vulnerable,

possible impact of counterfeit semiconductors,

manufacturing capacities and other risks that may disrupt, compromise or negatively affect the supply chain. Those risks could include supply chains with a single point of failure or which are otherwise highly concentrated. Other relevant factors could include the availability of substitutes or alternative sources for critical inputs and resilient and sustainable transport. The Commission should, assisted by the European Semiconductor Board and taking also into account information received from the main user categories, develop a Union level risk assessment.

(37)

In order to forecast and prepare for future disruptions of the different stages of the semiconductor

value

chain in the Union, the Commission should, assisted by the European Semiconductor Board, identify early warning indicators in the Union risk assessment. Such indicators could include the availability of raw materials, intermediate products and human capital needed for manufacturing semiconductors, or appropriate manufacturing equipment, the forecasted demand for semiconductors on the Union and global markets, price surges exceeding normal price fluctuation, the effect of accidents, attacks, natural disasters or other serious events, the effect of trade policies, tariffs, export restrictions, trade barriers and other trade related measures, and the effect of business closures, delocalisations or acquisitions of key market actors. Member States should monitor these early warning indicators.

(38)

A number of undertakings providing semiconductor services or goods are assumed to be essential for an effective semiconductor supply chain in the Union’s semiconductor ecosystem

, due to

the number of

Union

undertakings relying on their products, their

Union

or global market share, their importance to ensure a sufficient level of supply or the possible impact of the disruption of supply of their products

or services

. The Member States should identify th

ose

key market actors in their

territory

.

(39)

Under Article 4 of

Regulation

(EU) 2019/452 establishing a framework for the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union

, in determining whether a foreign direct investment is likely to affect security or public order, Member States and the Commission may consider its potential effects on critical technologies and dual use items as defined in point 1 of Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009

, including semiconductors.

(40)

As part of the monitoring, Member States

could

specifically consider the availability and integrity of the services and goods of key markets actors. Such

issues

could

be brought to the attention of the European Semiconductor Board by the Member State concerned.

(41)

For a

rapid, efficient and coordinated Union response to a semiconductor

crisis

it is necessary to

provid

e

timely and up-to-date information to the decision-makers on the unfolding operational situation as well as by

ensuring that

effective measures to secure the supply of semiconductor

s to affected critical sectors

can be taken

.

(42)

The

semiconductor crisis

stage

should be triggered in the presence of concrete, serious, and reliable evidence of

such a

crisis. A semiconductor crisis occur

s

in case of

serious

disruptions to the supply of semiconductors

leading to

significant

shortages

which entail significant delays and negative effects on

one or more

important economic sectors in the Union, either directly or through ripple effects of the shortage, given that the Union’s industrial sectors represent a strong user base of semiconductors. Alternatively or in addition, a semiconductor crisis also occur

s

when

serious

disruptions of the supply of semiconductors

lead to

significant

shortages which

prevent the

supply,

repair and maintenance of essential products used by critical sectors, for instance medical and diagnostic equipment

.

(43)

In order to ensure an agile and effective response

to such a semiconductor crisis

, the Commission

should be empowered to

activate the crisis stage by means of

an implementing

acts and for a predetermined duration period

, taking into account the opinion of the European Semiconductor Board

. The Commission should assess the need for prolongation and prolong the duration of the crisis stage for a predetermined period, should such a necessity be ascertained, taking into account the opinion of the European Semiconductor Board.

(44)

Close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and coordination of any national measures taken with regard to the semiconductor supply chain is indispensable during the crisis stage with a view to addressing disruptions with the necessary coherence, resiliency and effectiveness. To this end, the European Semiconductor Board should hold extraordinary meetings as necessary. Any measures taken should be strictly limited to the duration period of the crisis stage.

(45)

Appropriate, effective and proportionate measures should be identified and implemented when the crisis stage is activated

without prejudice to possible continued international engagement with relevant partners with the view to mitigating the evolving crisis situation

. Where appropriate, the Commission should request information from undertakings along the semiconductor

supply

chain. Furthermore, the Commission

should be able to

, where necessary and proportionate, oblige Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries to

accept and

prioritise

an order of

the production of crisis-relevant products, and to act as a central purchasing body when mandated by Member States.

The Commission

could

limit the measures to certain critical sectors.

In addition, the European Semiconductor Board may advise on the necessity of introducing an exp

o

rt control regime pursuant to Regulation

(EU)

2015/479 of the European Parliament and of the Council

. The European Semiconductor Board may also assess and advise on further appropriate and effective measures. The use of all these emergency measures should be proportionate and restricted to what is necessary to address the significant disturbances at stake

insofar as this is in the best interest of the Union. The Commission should regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of the measures taken and the underlying reasons. The Commission may

, after consulting with the Board,

issue further guidance on the implementation and use of the emergency measures.

(46)

A number of sectors are critical for the proper functioning of the internal market. Th

o

se critical sectors

are

the

sectors

listed in the

Annex

of the Commission proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the resilience of critical entities

. For the purposes of this Regulation, defence

and other activities that are relevant for public safety and security

should be additionally considered as a critical sector. Certain measures should only be enacted

fur the purpose of

secur

ing

supply to critical sectors. The Commission

may

limit the emergency measures to certain of these sectors

or to certain parts of them

when the semiconductor crisis has disturbed or is threatening to disturb their operation.

(47)

The purpose of requests for information from undertakings along the semiconductor supply chain

established in the Union

in the crisis stage is

an in-depth

assess

ment

of the semiconductor crisis

in order

to identify

potential mitigation or emergency measures at Union or national level. Such information may

include production capability,

production capacity and current primary disruptions and bottlenecks. These aspects could include the typical and current actual stock of crisis-relevant products in its production facilities located in the Union and third country facilities which it operates or contracts or purchases supply from; the typical and current actual average lead time for the most common products produced; the expected production output for the following three months for each Union production facility; reasons that prevent the filling of production capacity; or other existing data necessary to assess the nature of the semiconductor crisis or potential mitigation or emergency measures at national or Union level. Any request should be proportionate, have regard for the legitimate aims of the undertaking and the cost and effort required to make the data available, as well as set out appropriate time limits for providing the requested information.

Undertakings should b

e

obliged to comply with the request and may be subject to penalties if they fail to comply or provide incorrect information.

Any information acquired should be subject to confidentiality rules.

Should an undertaking be subject to a request for information

related to its semiconductor activities

from a third country, it should inform the Commission

so to enable an assessment whether an information request by the Commission is warranted

.

(48)

In order to ensure that critical sectors can continue to operate in a time of crisis and when necessary and proportionate for this purpose, Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries

could

be obliged

by the Commission

to

accept and

prioritise orders of crisis-relevant products.

This obligation may also be extended to semiconductor manufacturing facilities which have accepted such possibility in the context of receiving public support.

The decision on a priority rat

ed

order should be taken in accordance with all applicable Union legal obligations, having regard to the circumstances of the case.

The priority rating obligation should take precedence over any performance obligation under private or public law

while it

should have regard for the legitimate aims of the undertakings and the cost and effort required for any change in production sequence

. Undertakings may be subject to penalties if they fail to comply with the obligation for priority rated orders.

(49)

The

undertaking

concerned

should be

obliged to accept and

prioritise

a priority rated order. In exceptional and duly justified cases, the

undertaking

could request the Commission to review the imposed obligation

. This applies either where the facility is unable to fulfil the order even if prioritised, be it due to

insufficient production capability or production capacity

, or because this would place an unreasonable economic burden and entail particular hardship on the facility.

(50)

Under the exceptional circumstance that an undertaking operating along the semiconductor supply chain in the Union receives a priority rated order request from a third country, it should inform the Commission of this request, so as to inform an assessment of whether, if there is a significant impact on the security of supply to critical sectors,

and the other requirements of necessity, proportionality and legality are satisfied in the circumstances of the case,

the Commission should likewise enact

a

priority rated order obligation.

(51)

In light of the

importance

to ensure the security of supply to critical sectors that perform vital societal functions,

c

ompliance with th

e

obligation

to perform a priority rated order

should not entail liability for damages towards third parties

for any breach of contractual obligations

that may result from the necessary temporary changes of the operational processes of the concerned manufacturer, limited to the extent the violation of contractual obligations was necessary for compliance with the mandated prioritisation.

Undertakings potentially within scope of a priority rated order should anticipate this possibility in the conditions of their commercial contracts.

Without prejudice to the applicability of other provisions, the liability for defective products, as provided for by Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985

,

is

not affecte

d

by this liability exemption.

(52)

The obligation to prioritise the production of certain products respects the essence of and will not disproportionately affect the

freedom

to conduct

a

business and the freedom of contract

laid down in

Article 16 of

the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘

the Charter

’)

and the right to property

laid down in

Article 17 of the

Charter

.

Any limitation of those rights in this Regulation will, in accordance with Article 52(1) of the Charter, be provided for by law, respect the essence of those rights and freedoms, and comply with the principle of proportionality.

(53)

When the crisis stage is activated, two or more Member States

could

mandate the Commission to aggregate demand and act on their behalf

for their public procurement

in the public interest, in accordance with existing Union rules and procedures, leveraging its purchasing power. The mandate

could

authorise the Commission to enter into agreements concerning the purchase of crisis-relevant products for

certain

critical sectors. The Commission should assess for each request the utility, necessity and proportionality in consultation with the Board. Where it intends to not follow the request, it should inform the concerned Member States and the Board and give its reasons. Furthermore, the

participating Member States

should be entitled to

appoint

representatives to

provide guidance and advice during the

procurement procedures and in the negotiation of the purchasing agreements. The deployment and use of purchased products should remain within the remit of the participating Member States.

(54)

During a semiconductor shortage crisis, it might become necessary that the Union considers protective measures. The European Semiconductor Board

may

express its views to

inform the Commission’s assessment of whether the market situation amounts to a

significant

shortage of essential products pursuant to Regulation

(EU)

2015/479.

(55)

In order to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this Regulation, cooperation and the exchange of information, the European Semiconductor Board should be established. The European Semiconductor Board

should

provide advice to and assist the Commission on specific questions.

These should include providing advice on the Chips for Europe Initiative to the Public Authorities Board of the Chips Joint Undertaking; exchanging information on the functioning of the Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries; discussing and preparing the identification of specific sectors and technologies with potential high social impact and respective security significance in need of certification for trusted products and addressing coordinated monitoring and crisis response. Furthermore, the European Semiconductor Board should ensure the consistent application of this Regulation, facilitate cooperation between Member States as well as exchange of information on issues relating to this Regulation. The European Semiconductor Board should support the Commission in international cooperation in line with international obligations, including in information gathering and crisis assessment.

In addition, the European Semiconductor Board should coordinate, cooperate and exchange information with other Union crisis response and crisis preparedness structures with a view to ensure a coherent and coordinated Union approach as regards crisis response and crisis preparedness mea

sures for semiconductor crises.

(56)

A representative of t

he Commission should chair the European Semiconductor Board. Each Member State’s national single point of contact should appoint at least one high-level representative to the European Semiconductor Board. They

could also

appoint different representatives in relation to different tasks of the European Semiconductor Board

, for example, depending on which

Chapter

of this Regulation is discussed in the meetings of the European Semiconductor Board

.

The

Commission

may establish sub-groups

and

should be entitled to establish working arrangements by inviting experts to take part in

the

meetings on an ad hoc basis or by inviting organisations representing the interests of the Union semiconductors industry, such as the Industrial Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor Technologies,

in its sub-groups as observers.

(57)

The European Semiconductor Board will hold separate meetings for its tasks under Chapter II and for its tasks under Chapter III and IV. Member States should endeavour to ensure effective and efficient cooperation in the European Semiconductor Board.

The Commission should be able to facilitate exchanges between the European Semiconductor Board and other Union bodies, offices, agencies and advisory groups.

In light of the importance of the supply of semiconductors for other sectors and the resulting need for coordination, the Commission should ensure participation by other Union institutions and bodies as observers in meetings of the European Semiconductor Board where relevant and appropriate in relation to the monitoring and crisis response mechanism established under Chapter IV.

In order to con

tinue and make use of the work following the implementation of Commission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox to address semiconductor shortages

, the European Semiconductor Board should carry out the tasks of the European Semiconductor Expert G

roup.

Once the European Semiconductor Board is operational, this expert group should cease to exist.

(58)

Member States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this Regulation. In this respect, each Member State should designate one or more national competent authorities for the purpose of effective implementation of this Regulation and ensure that those authorities are adequately empowered and resourced. Member States

could

designate an existing authority or authorities. In order to increase organisation efficiency in the Member States and to set an official point of contact vis-a-vis the public and other counterparts at Member State and Union levels, including the Commission and the European Semiconductor Board, each Member State should designate, within one of the authorities it designated as competent authority under this Regulation, one national single point of contact responsible for coordinating issues related to this Regulation and cross-border cooperation with competent authorities of other Member States.

(59)

In order to ensure trustful and constructive cooperation of competent authorities

at

Union and national level, all parties involved in the application of this Regulation should respect the confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks.

The Commission and the national competent authorities, their officials, servants and other persons working under the supervision of these authorities as well as officials and civil servants of other authorities of the Member States should not disclose information acquired or exchanged by them pursuant to this Regulation and of the kind covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.

This

should also apply

to the European Semiconductor Board and the

Semiconductor

Committee

established in this Regulation

.

Where appropriate, the Commission should

be able to

adopt implementing acts to specify the practical arrangements for the treatment of confidential information in the co

ntext of information gathering.

(60)

Compliance with the obligations imposed under this Regulation should be enforceable by means of fines and periodic penalty payments. To that end, appropriate levels of fines and periodic penalty payments should also be laid down for non-compliance with the obligations

.

Limitation periods should apply for the impositions of fines and periodic penalty payments, in addition to limitation periods for the enforcement of penalties.

In addition, t

he Commission should give the concerned undertaking or representative organisations of undertakings the right to be heard.

(61)

The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in order to amend Annex I to this Regulation to reflect technological change and market developments, with regard to the actions set out therein in a manner consistent with the objectives of this Regulation and to amend Annex II thereto with regard to the measurable indicators where considered to be necessary as well as to supplement this Regulation with provisions on the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework.

It is of particular importance that the Commission carr

ies

out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making

.

In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

(62)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the selection of

ECICs

and as regards the

procedure for establishing

and defining the tasks of

competence centres and

the procedure for establishing the network

, so that the objectives of the Initiative are achieved

.

Furthermore, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission

as regards

activating the crisis stage in a semiconductor crisis, to allow a

rapid and coordinated response,

and for

specifying the practical arrangements for the treatment of confidential information

.

Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011

of the European Parliament and of the Counci

l

of the European Parliament and of the Council

.

(63)

Since the objective of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5

o

f the Treaty.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

order

of crisis-relevant products

(‘priority rated order’)

.

Th

e

obligation shall take precedence over any

performance

obligation under private or public law

.

2.

The obligation under paragraph 1 can also be imposed to other semiconductor

undertaking

s

which have accepted such possibility in the context of receiving public support

.

3.

When a semiconductor undertaking established in the Union is subject to a third country priority rated order measure, it shall inform the Commission. Should that obligation significantly impact the operatio

n of certain critical sectors, t

he Commission may oblige that undertaking to accept and prioritise orders of crisis relevant products in line with paragraph 4, 5 and 6.

4.

The obligation

s

under paragraph 1

, 2 and 3

shall

be enacted by the Commission via decision

. The decision shall be taken in accordance with all applicable Union legal obligations, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the principles of necessity and proportionality.

The decision

shall

in particular

have regard for the legitimate aims of the

undertaking

concerned

and the cost and effort required

for any change in

production sequence

.

In its decision, the Commission shall state the legal basis of the priority rated order, fix the time-limit

within which the order is to be performed, and, where applicable,

specify the product and quantity,

and

state

the penalties provided for in Article

28

for non-compliance with the obligation.

The priority rated order shall be placed at fair and reasonable price

.

5.

The

undertaking

concerned

shall be

obliged to accept

and

prioritise

a

priority rated order

.

The

undertaking

may

request the Commission

to

review

the priority rated order where

it considers it to be

duly justified

based

on one of the following grounds:

(a)

if the

undertaking

is unable to perform the priority rated order on account of insufficient production capability or production capacity, even under preferential treatment of the order

;

(b)

if acceptance of the order

would place an unreasonable economic burden and

entail

particular hardship for the

undertaking

.

6.

Where a

n

undertaking

is obliged to

accept and prioritise

a priority rated order

,

it

shall

not be liable for

any

breach of contractual obligations

that is

required

to comply with

the

priority rated orders

.

The liability

shall be excluded only

to the extent the violation of contractual obligations was necessary for compliance with the mandated prioritisation.

Set up the Chips for Europe Initiative, to support large-scale technological capacity building throughout investment into cross-border and openly accessible innovative infrastructures set up in the Union to enable the development of cutting-edge and next-generation semiconductor technologies that will reinforce the EU’s advanced design, systems integration, and chips production capabilities (pillar 1, “Chips for Europe Initiative”).

Create a framework to ensure security of supply by attracting investments and enhanced production capacities in semiconductor manufacturing as well as advanced packaging, test, and assembly via first-of-a-kind Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries (pillar 2, “Security of supply”).

Set up a coordination mechanism between the Member States and the Commission for strengthening collaboration with and across Member States, monitoring the supply of semiconductors, estimate demand, anticipate shortages, trigger situations of crisis and act through a dedicated toolbox of measures (pillar 3, “Preparedness and Monitoring”).

1.2.3.

Expected result(s) and impact

Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.

The Union’s semiconductor industry should benefit from support to large-scale technological capacity building in cutting-edge and next-generation semiconductor technologies that will reinforce the EU’s advanced design, systems integration, and chips production capabilities. Semiconductor facilities will benefit from more effective permit granting processes.

The Union’s semiconductor users in all sectors should benefit from increased security of supply of semiconductors without disruptions. In addition, critical sectors should benefit from enhanced security of supply of semiconductors.

End-users of products with semiconductors should benefit from increased security of supply, against more attractive market prices.

The competitiveness of the European semiconductor ecosystem will improve.

1.2.4.

Indicators of performance

Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.

Performance indicators are mostly relevant for the Chips for Europe Initiative. Annex II gives first versions of measurable indicators to monitor the implementation and to report on the progress of the Initiative towards the achievement of its objectives:

1.

The number of legal entities involved (subdivided by size, type and country of establishment) in the actions supported by the Initiative.

2.

The number of design tools developed or integrated under the Initiative.

3.

The total amount co-invested in design capacities and pilot lines under the Initiative.

4.

The number of users or user communities getting access to design capacities and pilot lines under the Initiative.

5.

The number of businesses, which have used the services of national competence centres supported by the Initiative.

6.

The number of persons who have received training to acquire advanced skills and training on semiconductor and quantum technologies supported by the Initiative.

7.

The number of start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs who have received venture capital from the Chips Fund and the total amount of capital investments made.

8.

The amount of investment by companies operating in the EU, taking into consideration the segment of the value chain in which they operate

1.3.

Grounds for the proposal/initiative

1.3.1.

Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative

The Regulation should be fully applicable shortly after its adoption, i.e. the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. However, initial elements should be in place before, supported by the Recommendation by the Commission, adopted at the same time as the proposed Regulation.

The European Semiconductor Board should be set up and Member States should have appointed a point of contact to its meeting. By the time of applicability the European Semiconductor Board should be fully operative.

Information gathering from representative organistions of semiconductor undertakings should alreay be on-going and Member States should have already discussed a number of possible measures in the crisis toolbox and carried out monitoring of the semiconductor value chain.

1.3.2.

Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.

Semiconductor chips are central to the digital economy. The global semiconductor shortage has exposed Europe’s dependency on supply from a limited number of companies and geographies, and its vulnerability to third country export restrictions and other disruptions in the present geopolitical context. Furthermore, this dependency is exacerbated by the extremely high barriers to entry and capital intensity of the sector. For example, the most computationally powerful chips require manufacturing to a precision of a few nanometers (nm). Building such facilities entails an upfront investment of at least EUR 15 billion and requires three years to achieve production-readiness with adequate yields. The expenditures to design such chips can range from EUR 0.5 billion to well over EUR 1.0 billion. R&D intensity in the sector is high and more than 15%. No single Member State is capable of achieving this alone.

Intervention at the level of the Union is best placed to address the challenges deriving from the complexity of the semiconductor ecosystem, from the Union’s structural dependencies and from far-reaching supply chain disruptions.

The Chips for Europe Initiative, should be set as a Union-wide initiative for supporting an industrial sector across Europe. A Union level initiative can provide the necessary degree of uniformity needed for the effective operation of funding programmes aimed at strengthening the Europen semiconductor ecosystem.

For the security of supply, Union level action is justified by the need for a uniform application of the new rules, in particular the definition of Integrated Production Facilities and Open EU Foundries, as well as a uniform procedure for their recognition and support.

Furthermore, a key element of this proposal is to provide for measures to address serious disruptions to vital societal functions or economic activities at Union level. Important coordination gains should arise from setting up a mechanism for coordination between Member States and the Commission for monitoring and crisis response to semiconductor shortages.

1.3.3.

Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past

The Commission published a Communication in 2013 on “A European Strategy for Micro- and Nanoelectronic Components and Systems”

. It proposed an industrial strategy to ensure return to growth and reach, in a decade, a level of production in the EU that is closer to its share of world GDP. In more detail, it aimed to:

-

Ensure the availability of micro- and nanoelectronics that are needed for the competitiveness of key industries in Europe.

-

Attract higher investment in advanced manufacturing in Europe and reinforce industrial competitiveness across the value chain from design to manufacturing.

-

Maintain leadership in equipment and material supply and in areas such as “more than Moore” and energy-efficient components.

-

Build leadership in the design of chips in high growth markets, notably in the design of complex components.

Clearly, the Union was not entirely successful in reaching the objectives of this industrial strategy.

One reason is that EU actions following the Communication largely focused on supporting R&D, for example via the ECSEL Joint Undertaking. However, capacity building in the microelectronics sector was not well addressed.

Furthermore, the Communication mentioned demand-side actions to be addressed. However, the actions undertaken did not adequately address such demand-side actions. More emphasis on demand-side actions, e.g. actions addressing design activities, is needed.

Finally, related to the first point, the 2013 Communication had few instruments at its disposal. Currently, more instruments are available, an opening in the competition policy has been provided, and the political momentum is now clearer.

1.3.4.

Compatibility with the Multiannual Financial Framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments

In order to maximise its positive impacts, the Chips for Europe Initiative (pillar 1) will build upon the strong knowledge base and enhance synergies with actions currently supported by the Union and Member States through programmes and actions in research and innovation in semiconductors and in developments of part of the supply chain. These include, in particular, the Horizon Europe Framework Programme and the Digital Europe Programme, with the aim to reinforce Europe as global player in semiconductor technology and its applications, with a growing global share in manufacturing by 2030. Complementing those activities, the Chips for Europe Initiative would closely collaborate with the Industrial Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor Technologies.

Furthermore, the Regulation provides for a procedural framework to facilitate combined funding from Member States, the EU budget and private investment.

The proposed initiative can be set in the context of a number of recently announced European policies and priorities:

-

Industrial Strategy;

-

Recovery Plan for Europe;

-

Green Deal;

-

Artificial Intelligence;

-

Research and Innovation under the proposed Horizon Europe programme, Pillar II Cluster “Digital, Industry and Space” aims to make concrete contributions to three overarching EU policies: ‘A Europe fit for the Digital Age’, ‘An economy that works for people’, and ‘A European Green Deal’.

-

Recovery and Resilience Facility

As regards possible synergies with other appropriate instruments, the role of competent authorities at national level can be performed by national authorities fulfilling similar functions under other Union law. See also Chapter 1 of the Explanatory Memorandum.

Comments

With the exception of a) activities and budgets related to the Chips Fund and b) activities and budgets earmarked under the European Innovation Council, the Chips for Europe Initiative will be implemented under indirect management by entrusting the implementation of tasks to the Key Digital Technologies Joint Undertaking, to be renamed to ‘Chips Joint Undertaking’. Member States and other Participating States are co-funding indirect actions.

Other parts, such as the activities under pillar 2 and 3, are under direct management. These concern tasks entrusted to the Commission to supervise the Chips JU, to review and decide on European Chips Infrastructure Consortium applications, to review and decide on applications for an Integrated Production Facility or Open EU Foundry, to support the European Semiconductor Board, and – together with Member States – to monitor semiconductor supply chains and decide on actions, where appropriate.

2.

MANAGEMENT MEASURES

2.1.

Monitoring and reporting rules

Specify frequency and conditions.

As a Union body, the Chips Joint Undertaking functions under strict monitoring rules. Monitoring is performed through:

-

its own internal audit capacity and the audit service of the Commission

;

-

the supervision of the Governing Board. The Executive Director will supervise the Joint Undertaking’s operations internally;

-

a set of quantitative and qualitative performance indicators which will be established to monitor the implementation of the programme and to measure its impact;

-

mid-term and final evaluations of the programme by external experts, under the supervision of the Commission;

-

the Joint Undertaking’s Work Programme and its Annual Activity Report.

2.2.

Management and control system(s)

2.2.1

Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed

The Regulation introduces a new policy framework with regard to attracting investment in and enhancing advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the Union and introduces harmonised rules for a coordinated approach to monitoring and preparedness for semiconductor shortages.

These new rules require a consistency mechanism for the cross-border application of the obligations under this Regulation and coordination of the activities of national authorities and of the Commission through a new advisory group, the European Semiconductor Board.

These tasks under direct management. In order to face these new tasks under pillar 2 and 3 and related to the Chips Fund, it is necessary to appropriately resource the Commission’s services.

For other parts, indirect management is justified because the Chips Joint Undertaking is a public private partnership with part of the co-financing brought in via contributions from Participating States and via in-kind contributions by private members.

Each year, the decision on the EU contribution to the Chips Joint Undertaking will be taken by virtue of the EU Budget adopted for that year.

A Framework Financial Partnership Agreement signed between the European Commission and the Chips Joint Undertaking will indicate that for the tasks to be carried out each year the Commission will pay a contribution upon conclusion of a Contribution agreement with the Chips Joint Undertaking, and the issuing, by the Joint Undertaking, of corresponding payment requests to the members other than the Union.

The Commission will ensure that the rules applicable to the Chips Joint Undertaking fully comply with the requirements of the Financial Regulation. In compliance with Article 71 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 the Joint Undertaking will respect the principle of sound financial management. The Chips Joint Undertaking shall also comply with the provisions of the Model Financial Regulation applicable to the Joint Undertaking. Any departure from this Model Financial Regulation, required for the purpose of the Joint Undertaking’s specific needs, shall be subject to the Commission’s prior consent.

Monitoring arrangements, including through the Union representation in the Governing Board and Public Authorities Board of the Chips Joint Undertaking, as well as reporting arrangements will ensure that the Commission services can meet the accountability requirements both to the College and to the Budgetary Authority.

The internal control framework for the Chips Joint Undertaking is built on:

-the implementation of the Internal Control Standards offering at least equivalent guarantees to those of the Commission;

-procedures for selecting the best projects through independent evaluation, and for translating them into legal instruments;

-project and contract management throughout the lifetime of every project;

-ex-ante checks on 100% of claims, including receipt of audit certificates and ex-ante certification of cost methodologies;

-ex-post audits on a sample of claims as part of the Horizon Europe ex-post audits;

-scientific evaluation of project results.

2.2.1.

Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them

Various measures have been established to mitigate the inherent risk of conflict of interest within the Chips Joint Undertaking, especially:

-equal votes (one third) for the Commission, Participating States (collectively) and for private members (collectively) in the Governing Board; equal votes (one half) for the Commission and Participating States (collectively) in the Public Authorities Board;

-high-level decisions on the activities/budgets dedicated to the activities of the chips initiative (capacity building in upcoming work programmes) are taken by the Public Authorities Board with Member States only,

-the part of the work programme dealing with capacity building activities is adopted by the Public Authorities Board with Member States only,

-selection of the Executive Director by the Governing Board based on a proposal by the Commission,

-independence of staff,

-evaluations by independent experts based on published evaluation criteria together with appeal mechanisms and full declarations of any interests,

-a requirement for the Governing Board to adopt rules for the prevention, avoidance and management of conflicts of interest in the Joint Undertaking in accordance with the financial rules of the Joint Undertaking and with the Staff Regulations in respect of staff.

The establishment of ethical and organisational values will be one of the key roles of the Joint Undertaking, and will be monitored by the Commission.

The Executive Director of the Chips Joint Undertaking, as Authorising Officer, will be required to introduce a cost-effective system of internal control and management. They will be required to report to the Commission on the internal control framework adopted.

The Commission will monitor the risk of non-compliance through the reporting system that it will develop, as well as by following the results of ex post audits on the recipients of EU funds from the Chips Joint Undertaking, as part of ex post audits covering the whole of the Horizon Europe.

There is a clear need to manage the budget in an efficient and effective manner, and to prevent fraud and waste. However, the control system needs to strike a fair balance between attaining an acceptable error rate and the control burden required and avoid lowering the attractiveness of the Union's Research programme.

2.2.3

Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of "control costs ÷ value of the related funds managed"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)

As the rules for participation of Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe programme applicable to the Chips Joint Undertaking are similar to those that the Commission will use in its work programmes, and with a population of beneficiaries with a similar risk profile to those of programmes under direct management, it can be expected that the error margin will be similar to that foreseen by the Commission for Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe programme, i.e. to give reasonable assurance that the risk of error over the course of the multiannual expenditure period is, on an annual basis, within a range of 2-5 %, with the ultimate aim to achieve a residual error rate as close as possible to 2 % at the closure of the multi-annual programmes, once the financial impact of all audits, correction and recovery measures have been taken into account.

2.3.

Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities

Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy.

The Commission will ensure that procedures to fight against fraud at all stages of the management process are applied by the Chips Joint Undertaking.

The Commission will ensure that appropriate measures are in place to ensure that, when actions financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interest of the Union is protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the amounts wrongly paid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportionate and deterrent penalties.

The Court of Auditors shall have the power of audit, on the basis of documents and on-the-spot checks, over all grant beneficiaries, contractors and subcontractors who have received Union funds under the Programme.

The European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly by such funding in accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union in connection with a grant agreement or grant decision or a contract concerning Union funding. The Joint Undertakings will also need to accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF).

The European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) may carry out investigations in accordance with the provisions and procedures laid down in Council Regulation (EU) 2017/193923, with a view to investigating criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union.

The proposal will not increase the total level of expenditure programmed under Heading 1 of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. Indeed, the contribution from the EU Budget to the Chips for Europe Initiative will be pooled from the Horizon Europe Programme and the Digital Europe Programme and, with the exception of the action under the European Innovation Council, channelled to the Key Digital Technologies (future Chips) Joint Undertaking for implementation. To this end, a sixth specific objective will be created under the Digital Europe Programme.

This sixth specific objective will be financed by

i

an internal redeployment of the current envelope of the Digital Europe Programme,

ii

a use of unallocated margin of Heading 1, and

iii

a reduction from the envelopes of the Connecting Europe Facility – Transport and the Connecting Europe Facility – Digital.

ANNEXES

PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

establishing a framework of measures for strengthening Europe's semiconductor ecosystem

(Chips Act)

Annex I

Actions

Technical description of the Initiative: scope of actions

The initial and, where appropriate, subsequent actions of the Initiative shall be implemented in accordance with the following technical description:

1.

Design capacities for integrated semiconductor technologies

The Initiative shall build up large-scale innovative design capacities for integrated semiconductor technologies through a virtual platform available across the Union. The platform will consist of new innovative design facilities with extended libraries and tools, integrating a large number of existing and new technologies (including emerging technologies such as integrated photonics, quantum and AI / neuromorphic). In combination with existing EDA design tools, it will allow to design innovative components and new system concepts and demonstrate key functionalities such as new approaches to high performance, low energy, security, new 3D and heterogeneous system architectures, etc.

Working closely with the user industries from a variety of economic sectors, the platform will connect the communities of design houses, IP and tool suppliers, with RTOs to provide virtual prototype solutions based on co-development of technology. Risks and development costs will be shared and new web-based methods of accessing design tools, with flexible cost models (especially for prototyping) and common interface standards will be promoted.

The platform shall be continuously upgraded with new design capabilities as it continuously integrates more and more technologies and designs for low-power processors (including open-source, such as RISC-V). It will offer its services via the cloud, maximising access and openness to the whole community by networking existing and new design centres across the Member States.

2.

Pilot Lines for

preparing for innovative

production, and testing and experimentation facilities

The Initiative shall support pilot lines for production and testing and experimentation facilities bridging the gap from the lab to the fab of advanced semiconductor technologies. Focus areas include:

(a)

Pilot lines to experiment, test, and validate, including through Process Design Kits, the performance of IP blocks, virtual prototypes, new designs and novel integrated heterogeneous systems in an open and accessible way.

The virtual platform above will allow design exploration of new IP blocks and new system concepts to be tested and validated on the pilot lines through early Process Design Kits, providing immediate feedback to refine and improve the models before transfer to manufacturing. From the start, the Initiative will expand several existing pilot lines, in synergy with the design infrastructure, to enable access for design and (virtual) prototyping projects.

(b)

New pilot lines on semiconductor technologies such as FD-SOI down to 10-7 nm, advanced Gate-All-Around and leading-edge nodes (e.g. below 2 nm), complemented by pilot lines for 3D heterogeneous systems inte

gration and advanced packaging.

The pilot lines will be integrating the latest research and innovation activities and their results.

The pilot lines will include a dedicated design infrastructure consisting for example of design models simulating the fabrication process for the design tools used to design circuits and systems-on-chip. This design infrastructure and a user-friendly virtualisation of the pilot lines will be set up that will make them directly accessible throughout Europe via the design platform above. Such link will enable the design community to test and validate technology options before these become commercially available. It will ensure that new chip and system design fully exploit the potential of new technologies and deliver cutting edge innovation.

Together, these pilot lines will advance European IP, skills and innovation in semiconductor manufacturing technology and will reinforce and expand the European position in new manufacturing equipment and materials for advanced semiconductor technology modules, such as e.g. lithography and wafer technologies.

Close concertation and collaboration with industry shall be organised to guide this capacity expansion and the critical inclusion from the start of selected qualified pilot lines involving for example advanced packaging, 3D heterogeneous integration technology and important additional functionalities like e.g., silicon photonics, power electronics, sensing technologies, silicon graphene, quantum technologies, etc. This powerful extended pan-European pilot line infrastructure, intimately connected with the design enablement infrastructure, is fundamental for expanding Europe’s knowledge, capacity and capabilities to close the innovation gap from publicly funded research to commercially funded manufacturing, and to increase both demand and manufacturing in Europe by the end of the decade.

3.

Advanced Technology and Engineering Capacities for quantum chips

The Initiative shall address the specific needs of the future generation of information processing components exploiting non-classical principles, notably chips exploiting quantum effects (i.e. quantum chips) based on research activities. Focus areas include:

(a)

Innovative

design libraries for quantum chips

building on the design and fabrication processes of the well-established processes of the classical semiconductor industry for semiconductor- and photonics-based qubit platforms; complemented by the development of

innovative and advanced

design libraries and fabrication processes for the alternative qubit platforms that are not compatible with semiconductors.

(b)

Pilot lines

for the integration of quantum circuits and control electronics for building quantum chips

building on and capitalising on ongoing r

e

search

; and, for providing access to dedicated clean rooms and foundries for prototyping and production, reducing the entry-barrier for the development and production of small volumes of quantum components and accelerating the innovation cycles.

(c)

Testing and experimentation facilities

for testing and validating

advanced

quantum components produced by the pilot lines, closing the innovation feedback loop between designers, producers and users of quantum components.

4.

A network of competence centres and skills development

The Initiative shall support:

(a)

The creation of a network of

competence centres

in each Member State to promote the use of these technologies,

acting as interfaces to the above-mentioned

advanced

design platform and pilot lines, facilitating their effective use, and providing expertise and skills to the stakeholders, including end-user SMEs. Competence centres will provide

innovative

services to industry, with particular attention to SMEs, academia and public authorities

delivering tailored solutions to a wide variety of users that will foster wider uptake of design and advanced technology in Europe.

They will also assist in growing a highly skilled work force in Europe.

(b)

On

skills

, specific training actions will be organised around design tools and semiconductor technologies at a local, regional or pan-European level.

Scholarships for graduate studies will be supported. These actions will complement industrial commitments under the Pact for Skills, increasing the number of internships and apprenticeships, in collaboration with academia.

A

ttention will

also

be paid to reskilling and upskilling programs for workers transferring from other sectors.

5.

‘

Chips Fund

’ activities

for access to capital by

start-ups, scale-ups,

SMEs

and

other companies in the semiconductor value chain

The Initiative shall support the creation of a thriving semiconductor and quantum innovation ecosystem by supporting wide access to venture capital for start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs to grow their business and expand their market presence in a sustainable manner.
