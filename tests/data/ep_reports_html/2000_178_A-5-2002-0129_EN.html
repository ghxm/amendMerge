<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   Introduction</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In recent years, numerous speeches and statements have cited the catalogue of food scandals (BSE, dioxin, sewage sludge, antibiotics and the administration of hormones to animals) as grounds for revising European food legislation. In response to the well-nigh hysterical reactions of public opinion, heads have rolled. Authorities have come up with measures which one would hardly have thought possible.</p>
<p class="text-left">Paradoxical though it may sound, it is only the recent food scandals that have made it possible for us to implement improvements in European food legislation which had long been called for.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, we cannot allow our actions to be dictated purely by such crises, as there is no longer any urgent need for action on their account: the crises have been weathered. Their legacy is a greater public awareness of food safety issues. We should make the most of this awareness at European level and respond to it by creating a new framework for food safety in Europe.</p>
<p class="text-left">We must adopt a broader approach than hitherto in our efforts to ensure food safety. Since the post-war period, food policy has been geared to the need to constantly increase and improve production, in the interests of food security. Today, at a time of general plenty and indeed oversupply, what is needed is a gradual change in the priorities of public policy so as to focus more on improving quality and diversity in the agrofood industry. The fact is that the public are questioning modern food production methods, and that their concerns go far beyond health and safety to embrace ecological and ethical values and such aspects as sustainable development and animal welfare. The above topics should therefore be disregarded in connection with food production hygiene.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   Food hygiene</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.1.</strong>   General food hygiene</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">How safe is our food? It is also necessary to consider what weaknesses need to be remedied in our current system for guaranteeing food safety. For example, in the light of the scandals of recent years, are food safety provisions insufficient or are they an example of over-regulation, so that they are difficult to apply?</p>
<p class="text-left">Food safety – protecting consumers against harm or hazards to health – has always been the prime concern of food law.</p>
<p class="text-left">The general prohibition on placing food on the market which is liable to harm health has long been supplemented in Community food law by a dense network of precautionary rules intended to prevent food from damaging health long before any actual damage can occur. This network includes the numerous maximum levels for pollutants and harmful substances, the detailed rules on food hygiene, the principle that additives, radiation and novel foods are not permitted until they have been explicitly approved, and a plethora of other precautions, too numerous to be reliably counted, contained in product regulations or in legislation which does not specifically relate to food but ultimately likewise contributes to food safety.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nowadays, the vast majority of these provisions are based on Community law, although to some extent Community provisions are still supplemented by the national laws of the Member States. From the point of view of food safety, relatively few regulatory loopholes remain. The Commission also points out in its white paper that the European food production chain is among the safest in the world and that on the whole the existing system is working well.</p>
<p class="text-left">As to whether food safety provisions are insufficient or constitute over-regulation, the answer must surely be ‘both’. Although copious, Community food legislation still displays considerable weaknesses. Each individual measure is confined to a particular sector, and there is no uniform approach. In particular, Community food law badly lacks consistency and legal quality. These shortcomings are not just a problem of formulation but have a substantive impact: they jeopardise the efficiency and enforcement of food regulations.</p>
<p class="text-left">The ‘radically new’ approach proposed by the Commission is all the more welcome, therefore, although upon closer inspection it is not so much a new approach to safety as a new approach to the legislation. This will make it possible to develop a body of Community food law containing uniform definitions and principles which will firstly be based on a comprehensive, unified approach (‘from fork to table’) and secondly create a clear and consistent series of food regulations. This consolidation of the hitherto incoherent mass of rules is indeed essential. At the same time, advantage should be taken of the consolidation process to thoroughly remedy the inadequate legal quality of many provisions.</p>
<p class="text-left">How should this be done? The Commission proposes that the new body of law should bring together and reorganise all existing hygiene provisions (17 directives) so as to alter the priorities. The proposed revision will moreover make it possible to draw a sharper dividing line between the fields of food hygiene, livestock epidemics and official meat inspections. In terms of substance, the proposals are based on the internationally recognised Codex Alimentarius. This includes the compulsory application of the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) system in all food businesses and greater individual responsibility for producers. The HACCP system is proposed as an instrument to be used by food producers to monitor critical points in the production process so as to avoid errors which could make food a health hazard. The system prescribes a series of logical steps which must be followed throughout the production process and makes it possible by means of risk analysis to identify those points in the production process which are decisive for the monitoring of food safety. Previously, the approach was rather one of monitoring intermediate products and end products.</p>
<p class="text-left">HACCP is intended as a way of helping food business operators to attain a higher standard of safety in the food they produce. HACCP is not an end in itself and does not replace official controls.</p>
<p class="text-left">In order to implement the principle of checks and uniform hygiene standards at every stage ‘from fork to table’, it should also be possible to apply the HACCP system to primary production, and this ought to be the goal. However, depending on the structure of the primary producer, the HACCP principle may also be replaced by guides to good practice. This option ought in particular to be provided for because the application of HACCP is compulsory.</p>
<p class="text-left">Guides to good hygienic practice should be drawn up by representatives of the food sector concerned. They should provide producers and processors with guidance on how to produce safe food. The advantage of such guides is that they will be specific to particular sectors and can go into a degree of detail which is hardly possible in legislation. They will supplement the hygiene provisions of Community law. Whether guides should be drafted at European or at national level is a matter to be decided case by case. If a European guide is drawn up for a particular sector, it should supersede existing national guides after a transitional period. Food producers should ensure the traceability of foodstuffs and food ingredients and adopt procedures for taking back products in emergencies. For this purpose they should keep records enabling them to identify the suppliers of ingredients and raw materials which they have used. As comprehensive provisions already exist to this effect, there is no need to repeat them in this regulation. It has become clear that some details of the Commission’s proposals are open to improvement. In particular, there are points which are unclear or which overlap or conflict between the proposals on food hygiene and the recently adopted proposals for a regulation on general food law, laying down fundamental principles and definitions as a general basis for European food law.</p>
<p class="text-left">A considerable number of necessary amendments to the present proposal for a regulation arise from the formulations used in the regulation on general food law. This particularly applies to Articles 2 and 10.</p>
<p class="text-left">An essential precondition for the supervision of food businesses is that they should be registered. Every business should register with the competent authority in writing, identifying all its premises. While all food businesses must register, this regulation also lays down approval requirements. Both infrastructural and operational requirements have to be complied with. The monitoring must be carried out by the official authorities.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.2.</strong>   Annexes concerning general food hygiene</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The annexes contain rules to be observed at the individual stages of production. The right preconditions should be created to enable primary production in particular to yield products which are safe. For this reason, Annex I in particular has been substantially amended.

As the annexes are subject to the legislative procedure laid down in Article 251 of the EC Treaty, it should likewise only be possible to amend them by that procedure.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>INTRODUCTION</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This proposal for a regulation contains general hygiene provisions covering all foodstuffs and is intended to replace the existing Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this process not only are provisions brought together and simplified but new principles are also introduced. The guiding principle is that food operators bear full responsibility for the safety of the food they produce. This approach which involves the food business operator taking responsibility is also reflected in the introduction of the HACCP system which, except for primary production, is to be mandatory for all those involved in the foodstuffs sector. This system is based on the producers carrying out their own checks and identifying critical points in the production process which are then subject to specific monitoring. The 'farm to table' principle is also new, i.e. the extension of the general hygiene provisions to primary production.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSAL</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The draftsman welcomes this proposal for a regulation and in particular the introduction of a comprehensive 'farm to table' approach which covers the whole of the food chain.</p>
<p class="text-left">By making food producers bear responsibility and applying the HACCP system, the producer has greater flexibility as far as production is concerned but must also provide written information on the processes involved in achieving the objective. Thus the path taken is not crucial but the result is, i.e. safe food. The same is true for primary production to which the general hygiene provisions also apply. Guides to good practice are to be developed which set out the possible hazards in the agricultural production process and the methods for combating them. The HACCP system is not to be applied to primary production initially, even though this may be considered by the Commission for the future. The draftsman would urge that consideration be given to introducing assessment criteria for own-checks.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even if there is a move towards food producers taking responsibility for their products, this does not mean that the Member States are freed of their monitoring responsibilities. Monitoring activities must, however, be brought into line with the use of the HACCP system and inspectors given appropriate training.</p>
<p class="text-left">The simplification of the provisions should not lead to existing levels of protection being reduced.</p>
<p class="text-left">Guides to good practice play an important role in the proposal for a regulation as a whole (i.e. not just for primary production). Provision is made for the possibility of Community guides but as a rule guides will be developed at national level. Such guides must not lead to variations in application of the hygiene provisions depending on the Member State.</p>
<p class="text-left">The draftsman is also in favour of the general registration or approval of businesses. This move will considerably facilitate monitoring and the traceability of products.</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal does not contain a definition of 'foodstuff'. As far as the other definitions in Article 2 are concerned, care must be taken to ensure consistency with the definitions in the other individual legal instruments.</p>
<p class="text-left">The flexibility provided in the proposal for small and medium-sized businesses, remote regions and traditional products is to be welcomed, but it should certainly not lead to food hygiene being compromised. It must be safeguarded by the Member States which decide to adopt such measures.</p>
<p class="text-left">Particularly where the safety of foodstuffs is concerned. steps must be taken to ensure that products imported from third countries comply with the same or equivalent standards. Appropriate documentary proof of such equivalence must be provided. In the context of the enlargement process the applicant countries should be prepared at this stage for the ambit of the provisions which will then be in force.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development calls on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as the committee responsible, to take account of the following conclusions in its report:</p>
<p class="text-left">1.   The regulation must be maintained as the legal form as it is the only way of ensuring a uniform application of the provisions throughout the European Union. It also offers the advantage of rapid application or adjustment.</p>
<p class="text-left">2.   The definitions in the various texts on food law must be uniform. It must be ensured that the definitions in this proposal are consistent with the proposal for a regulation laying down the general principles and requirements of food law (COM(2000) 716).</p>
<p class="text-left">3.   Official checks are an essential part of a functioning monitoring and safety network for foodstuffs hygiene. Such checks must therefore be appropriate to the aims of the Regulation. Official checks must be adapted to the application of the HACCP system.</p>
<p class="text-left">4.   Within the HACCP system <strong>written</strong> documentation must exist in all cases, as it is essential for appropriate monitoring.</p>
<p class="text-left">5.   Consideration must be given to whether, in order to ensure uniform provisions and avoid distortion of competition, it would not be more sensible to establish Community guides. However, at the least procedures must be established with regard to how these national guides can be examined and coordinated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="text-left">6.   In the context of the enlargement of the European Union transitional provisions in the field of hygiene of foodstuffs must be avoided as far as possible. If, however, there should be transitional provisions, these must be incorporated into a fixed timetable and monitored by means of regular interim reports.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>AMENDMENTS</strong></p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   Introduction</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Since 1964, in response to the needs of the internal market and the necessity for high levels of protection, 17 different Council Directives have been adopted and developed to cover the areas of food hygiene and public health, official controls on products of animal origin and the animal health aspects of placing these products on the market.</p>
<p class="text-left">This has resulted in a complex and confused situation, not least with regard to fisheries products and has led to the mixing of rules on hygiene, animal health and official controls and the existence of different hygiene regimes for products of animal origin and other food.</p>
<p class="text-left">The aim of the current Commission proposals is to simplify and clarify the legislation by separating food hygiene issues from those relating to official controls and animal health and thus eliminate the inconveniences that were inherent in the piecemeal approach of the 17 Directives.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   The Commission Proposals</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">There are five separate proposals contained in the Commission package: 4 draft Regulations which take up, modify and consolidate the content of the various Directives and one draft Directive which would then repeal the original 17 Directives.</p>
<p class="text-left">Proposals 1 and 2 deal with food hygiene. The first of these is a horizontal measure applicable to all food, while the second contains specific rules for food of animal origin. Proposal 3 deals with official controls on food of animal origin and proposal 4 deals with animal health issues, resulting from the consolidation of the hygiene rules and related to the production, placing on the market and importation of products of animal origin.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 1 - Hygiene of Foodstuffs</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This draft Regulation, which would replace Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs, contains the general hygiene rules applicable to all food and is based upon the following principles:</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Food business operators must continue to have the primary responsibility for food safety,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles prescribed by that Codex Alimentarius organisation should be introduced. It is proposed that this system should be mandatory for all food establishments and adopted as a management tool by food business operators to ensure food safety,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Food business operators must ensure traceability of food and food ingredients and must put in place products withdrawal procedures in case of food emergencies.</p>
<p class="text-left">–   It should be applied from "farm to table",</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Codes of good practice should be established by the various food sectors in order to give guidance to food business operators on food safety,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Imports from and imports to Third Countries must comply with Community hygiene standards,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Flexibility to cope with the special needs of small businesses and those operating in peripheral regions and remote areas such as mountains or islands. Special provision should be made for traditional food production and for the implementation of HACCP in particular in small businesses.</p>
<p class="text-left">The possibility for granting derogations on an ad hoc basis is provided for.</p>
<p class="text-left">A special Annex is devoted to primary production. It contains the elements that are considered essential to ensure food safety at that level, i.e.</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Codes for good farming (fishing) practice,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Record keeping on food safety issues.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 2 - Specific Hygiene Rules for Food of Animal Origin</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This draft Regulation provides for specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (meat, milk, fish etc.) because of the different risks involved. These rules have been reduced from 14 different Directives into one much simplified text which offers more flexibility to food operators for defining the "in house" measures to be taken to ensure safe food.</p>
<p class="text-left">This proposal also contains provisions to ensure flexibility for small enterprises and traditional food.</p>
<p class="text-left">With regard to the fisheries sector, it covers the special hygiene conditions for the production, harvesting and transport of live bivalve molluscs, the rules for dispatch and purification centres and the health, labelling, packaging, storage and transport of the product.</p>
<p class="text-left">In respect of fishery products, the Regulation lays down the conditions for fisheries vessels including factory and freezer ships and stipulates the hygiene requirements applicable on board, and during and after landing. Health standards for fishery products are also set out. Finally, measures are proposed relating to the wrapping and packaging of fishery products, their storage and transport and the approval and registration of establishments.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 3 - Official Controls on Products of Animal Origin</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This proposal is a consolidation of the rules for official controls on products of animal origin, such as meat inspection and the control of harvesting areas for molluscs (Annex III). It represents mainly a consolidation of the multiplicity of control provisions scattered over the different Directives.</p>
<p class="text-left">No major innovations have been introduced, but in some cases there has been a shift of emphasis, e.g. the need to perform controls throughout the length of the food chain.</p>
<p class="text-left">In addition to the common control requirements, the official controls on fishery products should be carried out at the time of landing or before first sale at an auction or wholesale market. These should include organoleptic examination, chemical analysis and various other forms of surveillance testing.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission proposes that the following should be declared unfit for human consumption</p>
<p class="text-left">(a)   fishery products which the organoleptic, chemical, physical or microbiological checks show are not fit for human consumption;</p>
<p class="text-left">(b)   fish or parts of fish which have not been properly examined to detect endo-parasites in accordance with Community legislation;</p>
<p class="text-left">(c)   fishery products which contain in their edible parts contaminants present in the aquatic environment, such as heavy metals and organochlorinated substances, at levels where the calculated dietary intake would exceed the acceptable daily or weekly intake for humans;</p>
<p class="text-left">(d)   poisonous fish and fishery products containing biotoxins;</p>
<p class="text-left">(e)   fishery products or parts thereof considered dangerous to human health.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 4 - Animal Health Rules</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Although not directly linked to hygiene, this proposal results from the recasting of the hygiene rules and is aimed at preventing the spread of animal diseases resulting from the placing on the market of products of animal origin.</p>
<p class="text-left">The benefit of this proposal would be that all animal health rules would now be contained in a single instrument instead of being scattered over 7 Directives.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are various provisions relating to the health of aquaculture fish and live molluscs.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 5 - Repeal Directive</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This proposal would repeal all 17 Directives and has a standstill clause for existing implementing rules.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>3.</strong>   Comments and Conclusions</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Fisheries welcomes these proposals and supports their objectives of simplification, coherence and consolidation, while at the same time maintaining a high level of protection for the consumer.</p>
<p class="text-left">In particular, it supports the concept that food operators must bear full responsibility for the food they produce, so long as this is operated fair-handedly across the board and applied equally on the same basis to Third Country imports as to Community producers.</p>
<p class="text-left">For this reason, the Committee also welcomes the Commission decision to formulate its proposals in the form of Regulations as opposed to Directives, so as to ensure a uniform regime throughout the Community. However, despite this, the fisheries sector will put great store by the provisions on flexibility.</p>
<p class="text-left">Although traceability, "farm or sea to table" and the HACCP principles can all contribute to greater food safety and as such must be supported, the fisheries sector will be particularly concerned that adequate consideration is given to the special needs of the communities which it supports. Almost by definition, fishing is concentrated in remote or peripheral coastal regions, where few alternative sources of employment exist. In this context, any regulatory environment must be applied with great sensitivity.</p>
<p class="text-left">Codes to good practice, may in these circumstances, represent the most practical solution and the most appropriate tool for the small and medium sized businesses which dominate the sector in these regions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Article 1 of the hygiene of foodstuffs proposal and Annex I of Proposal 2 on specific hygiene rules, provide detailed definitions of primary and processed products and of live bivalve molluscs and fishery products. This represents a step forward for the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our Committee has consistently made the point, that while primary agricultural production has usually been taken to include fisheries products, fishing and aquaculture are covered by a quite separate Common Fisheries Policy, providing for specific provisions in Community food law to cover the sector.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, as recently as 1996, the Commission and Council, without consultation of the European Parliament, succeeded in foisting upon the fishing industry, charges to finance veterinary inspections under a directive originally designed to deal with <strong>meat</strong>. (Council of <strong>Agriculture </strong>Ministers decision of 24-27 June 1996, with regard to the Commission proposal to modify Directives (EEC)85/73()<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part10_ref1" href="#_part10_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 10.1">[1]</a>, (EEC)90/675()<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part10_ref2" href="#_part10_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 10.2">[2]</a> and (EEC)91/496)()<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part10_ref3" href="#_part10_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 10.3">[3]</a>. </p>
<p class="text-left">Legislation must be based on an assessment of the risks involved. In this particular instance however, this was patently obviously not the case, nor was any account taken of the specific nature of the "particular category of foodstuff" involved. Clear definitions and more transparent regulations should help to make such instances a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In conclusion, the Committee on Fisheries would point out that:</p>
<p class="text-left">a)   A regulatory regime must take account of the varying degrees of risk presented by different businesses according to their operating practices. General and uniform principles can and should be adopted centrally. However, these must be applied sensitively in peripheral and remote areas dependent on a particular segment of the food production industry, while at the same time the strict application of the rules must continue to be guaranteed in all cases.</p>
<p class="text-left">b)   The Fish Hygiene Directive (EEC) 91/493 <a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part10_ref4" href="#_part10_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 10.4">[4]</a> embraced the concept of self-monitoring and the responsibility of the industry to carry out its own controls. As the Commission states "the leitmotif throughout the recast of the hygiene rules is that food operators bear full responsibility for the safety of the food they produce. The implementation of hazard analysis and control principles and the observance of hygiene rules must ensure this safety." </p>
