<p class="text-center"><strong><strong>A)</strong>   The Revision of the Electricity Market Directive</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">EU Parliament internal rules only allow for a 4-page explanatory statement. A more complete version of this memorandum with extensive statistics and examples can be found under http://www.eu-energy.com/Electricity.html or tel. 0032–2–2845246 (office of MEP Claude Turmes).</p>
<p class="text-left">Quantitative issues, like the speed of market opening, have dominated the debate around liberalisation. Although harmonised dates for full market opening are a prerequisite for a well functioning market, qualitative aspects must be brought to the centre of the political debate if a truly functioning market is to be established.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong><u>1)</u></strong>   <u>A non-biased market for generation</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission’s proposal puts insufficient emphasis on equal market conditions for different competing energy sources and largely ignores commercial and administrative distortions which favour some market actors.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Take care of security of supply aspects:</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The California crisis shows the need to monitor the evolution of generation in liberalised markets. The measures proposed by the Commission – tendering schemes, monitoring of the market – should also be followed by the Parliament. The Commission’s paper largely ignores the potential of energy efficiency measures to increase security of supply, which must be redressed.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>A level playing field for sustainability:</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">New investments in sustainable electricity production have to compete with the existing fossil fuel or nuclear generation that have received significant state aid.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>The right price</u>. In parallel to the Directive a strategy has to be developed to reduce state aid and subsidies to conventional energies and to internalise external environmental costs. Until then sustainable energy production should receive protection in the market through this Directive, through sector Directives and special EIB investment funds.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>Environmental Reciprocity</u>. Certain Member States are making a lot of progress on renewables, CHP and DSM while others are lagging behind. In order not to bring the frontrunners in a competitive disadvantage, a sort of environmental reciprocity clause should be adopted. An environmental reciprocity clause would allow Member States to ban the import of electricity if the exporting country fails to meet targets such as those in the Renewable Energy Directive and future Directives on Combined Heat and Power or Energy Efficiency.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>Electricity Importation</u>: There was a seven-fold increase in electricity imported from countries in Central Europe between 1996-2000. A number of States (Austria and Luxembourg) have expressed concerns that this may lead to a distortion of the market and passed appropriate legislation. The European Parliament has already called for imported electricity to meet EU environmental standards. The Directive should require the same environmental and social minimum standards for imported electricity as for new generation and the same disclosure requirements.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>A level playing field for market actors:</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In the creation of a single market from 15 national markets there is a need to harmonise the framework conditions for the different actors.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>Market Concentration: </u>The avoidance of market dominance is of particular importance in this sector as electricity cannot be stored and therefore the possibility to exercise market power is much greater than in other commodities. The revised Directive proposes that market concentration is reviewed, but clear guidelines are required. Three problems have to be addressed:</p>
<p class="text-left">-   in some Member States operators control more than 50% of the market;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   in other Member States the sale of and merger between electricity companies have been more guided by industrial policy interests rather than by transparent merger control;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   the ten largest companies control over 50% of the EU market. Further mergers of these companies are planned and it is expected that within a few years only between 5-8 companies will dominate.</p>
<p class="text-left"></p>
<p class="text-left">Source: Jean-Michel Glachant</p>
<p class="text-left">In order to analyse market dominance it is crucial to define the relevant market. Due to the physical constraints of electricity the relevant market is not the EU 15 but is often limited to just one or two countries. Building more interconnection will not dramatically improve this situation.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>Missing harmonisation of the economic framework conditions:</u> Market dominance, cross subsidies from captive clients and collusion of interests between grid and generation owners give competitive advantages that have to be addressed. Other relevant market distortions are stranded cost arrangements, the availability of funds (such as the German decommissioning fund) and divergent national regulations, e.g. decommissioning requirements.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong><u>2)</u></strong>   <u>A functioning retail market</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">If the liberalised market is to bring universal benefits then the organisation of the retail (sales) market has to be completed in a way that gives full transparency and information to the final consumers.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Complete Market opening:</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">As of early 2000, it was estimated that around 70% of the supply market was open to competition, rather than the 26% required under the terms of the Directive. Uneven market opening causes a distortion of competition in the energy market. The Directive calls for retail market opening for non-domestic customers by 1 January 2003 and for domestic customers by 1 January 2005. Any further delay in opening up the markets may only be tolerated under very strict cross-subsidy control by the national regulators.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>More market power to small customers:</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Whereas large industrial customers are able to negotiate reductions in their bills, this has not happened to the same degree for the majority of citizens. The Directive should seek to improve market power for small customers by favouring aggregation and by giving a greater role to local utilities. Monitoring transparency of contracts, maximum fees for connection costs and costs of metering should all be functions of the regulating bodies.</p>

<p class="text-left"><strong>Full disclosure of information</strong>:</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposed Directive includes a requirement for consumers to be given information about the sources, price and certain environmental impacts of fuels. The mandatory disclosure of electricity sources is increasingly common. In the USA 19 States have disclosure legislation in place. In Austria from October 2001 utilities have to disclose the production sources; similar legislation is expected in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Parliament should support the Commission’s initiative, but refinements are required to ensure that appropriate information appears both on the bills of consumers and in advertising. The Directive should also ensure that in every country an independent body produces comparative information for customers.</p>

<p class="text-left"><strong>Preventing negative effects on electricity demand</strong>:</p>
<p class="text-left">One of the biggest problems of the liberalised market is the negative impact on energy efficiency. If the EU is to take seriously the environmental and security of supply concerns, this market failure has to be addressed. In addition to technical measures, such as improving the efficiency of electric appliances, structural measures have to be included within the Directive. Increased demand-side management not only for retailers but also for transmission and distribution companies is also required. Funding mechanisms to finance Demand Side Management (DSM) for small customers must be provided.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Municipal Utilities:</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Local utilities are important actors in the newly created markets and can help to strengthen the market power of small customers and to implement demand-side policies. The proposed Directive allows utilities supplying less than 100 000 customers to be exempt from distribution unbundling. Such a scheme should be encouraged but better defined. Therefore all utilities which have less than 200 000 customers should be exempt and it should also apply to all municipal and community utilities regardless of their size. However, it is essential that all distribution service operators (DSOs) which are majority owned, directly or indirectly, by another electricity company, in this regard are considered as one DSO.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>3)</strong>   A non discriminative grid</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Ensuring neutrality</strong>:</p>
<p class="text-left">As not all countries have separated the ownership of grid and commercial activities in the generation and retailing sectors, the regulating bodies have an essential role in ensuring the neutrality of the grid actors. Recent experience shows that transparent ex-ante price setting is a prerequisite for a well functioning market. For better congestion management, more transparency and new instruments have to be implemented.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Guaranteeing security of supply:</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The quality of the grid is of key importance for the proper functioning of the economy and society. The grid operators must be able to maintain and, where appropriate, reinforce the infrastructure.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Decentralised Power Sources</strong>:</p>
<p class="text-left">There is a need to address the bias in investment and operating regimes towards centralised production and the transmission systems. Decentralised power systems have significant avoided cost advantages, as new grid infrastructures can be avoided or existing ones freed up, which are not always reflected in the tariffs.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>4)</strong>   Competent and independent regulators</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The experience of the first years of liberalisation shows that strong ‘referees’ are needed if a fair and transparent market is to be established. In the transition to full liberalisation regulators have an important role to play in establishing, monitoring and continuously adapting the structures and rules of the market. Due to the complexity of the electricity market they have also a role to play in advising on competition policies. The role and the activities of the 15 national regulators have to be harmonised at a minimum level and coordination has to be established between them.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>5)</strong>   Public service obligations (PSOs)</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The free market will not take care of certain important aspects like social exclusion, universal service, territorial aspects, security of supply and certain environmental considerations. Special attention should be devoted to this chapter of the Directive in order to allow a certain number of PSOs and to enable the creation of funds to finance these obligations.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong><strong>B)</strong>   The Revision of the Gas Market Directive</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In putting forward the proposals amending Directives 96/92/EC (internal market in electricity Directive) and 98/30/EC (internal market in gas Directive) in March 2001, the Commission has complied with the demand made by the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000 to complete the internal market in natural gas and electricity and the European Parliament's request to issue a timetable.</p>
<p class="text-left">The objective is to accelerate the opening of the energy sector market by gradually introducing competition and to boost the efficiency of the energy sector and the competitiveness of the European industry.</p>
<p class="text-left">The core elements to be considered are as follows:</p><ul class="d-table mb-1 pl-2"><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">the setting of a timetable for complete market opening;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">legal unbundling;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">the regulation of the network offers of third parties;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">the regulatory authorities;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">monitoring security of supply, including of biogas or gas from biomass, investment obligations;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">notification obligations;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">effects on employment;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell">public services.</span></li></ul>
<p class="text-left">Since a working document is necessarily limited in scope, it is only possible to give a summary here. Your rapporteur will therefore only touch on the most controversial points and is unable to do full justice to the arguments for and against. A more comprehensive analysis is available on the rapporteur's home page <strong>www.rapkay.de</strong>. Justifications in respect of individual points will be provided when specific amendments are tabled to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   More rapid opening of the market</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Directive 98/30/EC set 20% in the year 2000 and 28% in 2003 as minimum targets for the opening of the market in gas.</p>
<p class="text-left">At first sight the minimum requirements of the directive have been far exceeded given that the average percentage opening is 79%. However, the extent of market opening varies greatly from one Member State to another. The high average rate can be attributed basically to three countries (Germany, the UK and Italy) which account for some two-thirds of the EU market in gas and have opened their markets at the rate of 100% and 96%.</p>
<p class="text-left">Furthermore, the official degree of market opening says nothing about the extent to which non-discriminatory competition really exists. In order to have functioning competition in the gas sector, two things are necessary: gas bids from competing independent suppliers on the one hand and guaranteed and enforceable costs-based, competitive and non-discriminatory payments for network access and access to the substantive facilities (for example storage) connected to it. To what extent the Commission's proposal to give commercial customers a choice from 2004 and to achieve the complete opening of the market from 2005 can be realised in practice will depend on the speed of the legislative procedure. An ambitious timetable should in any case be maintained and initially no changes should be made to the planned schedule.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>II.</strong>   Legal unbundling</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">If a genuine internal market is to develop, there must be effective market structures, and the approaches of the various Member States in opening the market must gradually merge. As regards the structure of the gas sector, the development of genuine supply side gas competition at the upstream end of the natural gas supply chain is also indispensable. The gas directive and competition policy both have an important role to play in achieving this objective.</p>
<p class="text-left">It follows from the above that effective unbundling and fair and non-discriminatory network access are needed.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>Law currently in force</u></p>
<p class="text-left">Under Directive 98/30/EC integrated undertakings are obliged to unbundle their transmission, distribution and storage activities by maintaining separate accounts and by treating sensitive financial information in a confidential manner.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>The Commission proposal</u></p>
<p class="text-left">In order to ensure non-discriminatory access to the network it is proposed that distribution system operators must be independent as of 2004 of all the other spheres of activity which are not connected to the operation of the network, at least as regards legal form, organisation and decision-taking powers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Member States may, however, decide not to apply these provisions to integrated natural gas undertakings which at this time supply fewer than 100 000 customers.</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal does not initially call for separate legal entities for supply, storage and LNG facilities. However, the Commission intends to continue to monitor carefully whether effective and non-discriminatory access develops for transmission, distribution, LNG and storage facilities.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur does not agree with the objection that the intended competition policy requirements constitute illegal interference in the fundamental right to property and entrepreneurial freedom.</p>
<p class="text-left">In order to ensure non-discrimination between the commercial department of a vertically integrated gas supply undertaking and a third party, financial unbundling must not be restricted to internal accounting, but must be made public. Net utilisation prices and energy prices must be shown separately in invoices to customers. The minimum precondition for this is that vertically integrated gas supply undertakings should become independent as a legally separate entity in a group of companies.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>III.</strong>   Access to the network</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><u>Law currently in force</u></p>
<p class="text-left">Under Article 14 of Directive 98/30/EC Member States may opt for regulated access or negotiable access or both procedures.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>The Commission's proposal</u></p>
<p class="text-left">The overwhelming majority of market players assume that the minimum system necessary to ensure non-discrimination and the necessary transparency and predictability as a precondition for the development of effective competition is published and regulated tariffs which are applied under non-discriminatory terms and conditions to all system users of the same category. In the electricity sector virtually all Member States have introduced this arrangement; but this has not happened to gas.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is therefore proposed that a single published and regulated tariff structure be the minimum norm for the transmission or distribution tariffs in both markets.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>IV.</strong>   Regulatory authorities</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><u>The present legal situation: Article 22</u></p>
<p class="text-left">Member States are obliged to create appropriate mechanisms for regulating, controlling and ensuring the transparency of the gas market to prevent undertakings abusing a dominant market position.</p>
<p class="text-left">In 14 Member States a national regulatory authority is responsible. In this area, Germany, however, has opted for a purely self-regulatory approach through the Verbändevereinbarung (association agreement) for gas.</p>
<p class="text-left"><u>Proposed Commission amendments</u></p>
<p class="text-left">The new Article 22 requires Member States to establish an independent national regulatory authority. The powers of this authority are regulated in detail.</p>
<p class="text-left">Under the new Article 4a, this regulatory authority may also be charged with monitoring security of supply. Its task is to monitor the balance between supply and demand on the national market, the expected development of supply and demand and the level of competition existing on the market</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur considers the issue of national regulatory authority versus self-regulation, negotiated versus regulated access to the market to be secondary. This dispute about how energy markets should be regulated is motivated by concise financial interests, not different regulatory philosophies. What is important is the content of this regulatory factor, its binding nature and legal claims concerning the details of regulation. Neither a thorough analysis of the different systems, nor their objectively measurable successes will make us conclude that either an association agreement according to the German model (so far) or a national regulatory authority - these vary considerably from one country to another - is the optimal solution.</p>
<p class="text-left">The future directive on the internal market in natural gas must provide for:</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>-</strong>   <strong>the binding nature and enforceability of the rules</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>-</strong>   <strong>the immediate enforceability of the provisions on abuse</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>-</strong>   <strong>the reversal of the burden of proof in the supervision of network tariffs</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>-</strong>   <strong>the standardisation of contracts, forms and notification procedures</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>-</strong>   <strong>an effective independent unit to impose fair conditions</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Finally, the question remains to what extent there should be ex ante controls on the conditions of access to and utilisation of the network (including tariffs). Here too the transition from an ex-ante to an ex-post viewpoint is fluid. Specifically ex-ante controls are not absolutely necessary. Where model decisions are complied with in a binding manner there is automatically a certain ex-ante effect which can be enhanced by the endorsement of association or individual negotiations by the authorities authorised by the Member States.</p></div><div class="separator separator-dotted separator-2x my-3"></div><h2 id="_section5">OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC AND MONETARY AFFAIRS</h2><div><p><strong>21 February 2002</strong></p>

<p class="text-left">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs appointed Ioannis Marinos draftsman at its meeting of 19 June 2001.</p>
<p class="text-left">It considered the draft opinion at its meetings of 3 December 2001, 23 January and 20 February 2002.</p>
<p class="text-left">At the latter meeting it adopted the following amendments by 35 votes, with 2 abstentions.</p>
<p class="text-left">The following were present for the vote: Christa Randzio-Plath, chairwoman; Philippe A.R.

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">1.   Owing to the uneven implementation of Directives 96/92/EC and 98/30/EC as regards the degree of market opening for electricity and natural gas, the internal market is still being severely disrupted and barriers to improving the conditions of competition between undertakings in the European Union persist. Even though the Commission proposal under review provides for different dates for the opening of the market to non-domestic consumers (all industrial and commercial entities), namely 1 January 2003 for electricity and 1 January 2004 for natural gas, it proposes that full market opening (100%) should be in place by 1 January 2005 for both markets.</p>
<p class="text-left">2.   This proposal is particularly apposite. Natural gas is the most environmentally-friendly fuel after renewable sources of energy – an important consideration, given the degree of environmental pollution – and is exceptionally efficient using combined cycle technology; supply prices are also significantly lower than for diesel. The full opening of both markets will further strengthen the structures for a competitive market.</p>
<p class="text-left">3.   Your draftsman considers that any delay in the opening of the markets will deter private investments - both domestic and foreign - and hinder the development of private companies. For it is difficult for viable investments to exist in closed markets. While the developed markets of the European Union have an increasing need for investments in the electricity and natural gas sectors, they find it difficult in practice to secure the necessary investments.</p>
<p class="text-left">4.   Your draftsman would also point out that the Directive on natural gas currently in force provides for the possibility of derogations in respect of certain provisions for Member States which are characterised as emerging markets and/or are not directly linked to the natural gas networks of other Member States. The Commission proposal under review maintains this possibility which also applies to the article which provides for the date for full market opening. Your draftsman endorses the Commission’s proposal, since this is a derogation granted only on objective and clearly-defined grounds and expires automatically as soon as the Member State covered by the derogation ceases to qualify as an emerging market.</p>
<p class="text-left">5.   As regards access to the network, the Commission proposal entrusts the regulatory authorities with the power to approve tariffs. This increase in powers enhances the role of the regulatory authorities of the energy sector which will not simply be advisory bodies, but enjoy formal and real independence and cooperate with each other and with the Commission.</p>
<p class="text-left">6.   Your draftsman agrees with the proposal, since he believes that the tariffs must reflect actual production costs, and that state intervention in fixing the tariffs is not the appropriate means to attain basic public service objectives. Objectives such as protecting vulnerable consumers, pursuing anti-inflationary policies and economic and social cohesion can be achieved more readily by other policies, for instance fiscal measures or social benefits, without removing transparency as regards the costs of production and without distorting genuine competition. Moreover, as the Commission has stressed in its Communication, suitable measures must be taken through national and Community policies, to address the likely adverse short-term consequences for employment, even though it is expected to rise in the medium and long term throughout European industry owing to increased energy efficiency and lower energy prices and the opportunities for new technologies resulting from the introduction of competition.</p>
<p class="text-left">7.   In order to achieve full liberalisation and the inter connection of the markets, new investments are necessary to develop the appropriate network infrastructure. The Commission proposals which are based on the principle of subsidiarity, leave this matter chiefly to the Member States. Your draftsman believes that the Community should be given an enhanced role in attaining this objective.</p>
<p class="text-left">8.   In conclusion, your draftsman shares the view that those countries which have fully opened the market have been more successful in attaining the objective of the Directives, namely lower prices, increased competitiveness, high levels of public services, security of supply and environmental protection. For this reason, he supports almost all the Commission proposals, bearing in mind that they are also supported by the International Federation of Industrial Energy Consumers, subject to the proposed amendments.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong><em>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</em></strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   Methodology</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission is proposing amendments to Directives 96/92/EC (electricity) and 98/30/EC (gas) in order to comply with the mandate of the European Parliament and the Lisbon European Council, which called for the full liberalisation of the energy markets and the speeding up of the liberalisation process for gas, electricity, postal services and transport. The aim, of course, was to achieve the liberalisation of the two sources of energy, electricity and gas, as nearly at the same time as possible simultaneously.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is therefore clearly sensible that the Commission has bundled together the two packages of amendments in a single proposal, given that the amendments to the existing directives are partly identical.</p>
<p class="text-left">Accordingly the Commission has set out its amendments in a Framework directive which contains three articles of substance:</p>
<p class="text-left">-   Article 1 containing the amendments to the Electricity Directive;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   Article 2 containing the amendments to the Gas Directive;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   Article 3 proposing the withdrawal of directives 90/547/EEC on the transit of electricity through transmission grids, and 91/296/EEC on the transit of natural gas through grids, thus simplifying the whole system of directives.</p>
<p class="text-left">Annexes I and II to the proposed Framework directive each also contain one further annex. These annexes contain a number of provisions aimed at protecting the end user, which go beyond the provisions of the Directive on unfair conditions in consumer contracts and the Directive on consumer protection in distance contracts.</p>
<p class="text-left">The reason for choosing this legal basis is not clear and complicates the planned reform.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your draftsman therefore proposes that Annex I be incorporated as it stands into Article 3(3) of Directive 96/92/EEC, and Annex II into Article 3(3) of Directive 98/30/EC, in order to create clarity and guarantee accessibility for citizens to the legislative texts. Normally the Commission only works with annexes when providing for the possibility of small (mainly technical) amendments which can for the sake of simplicity best be carried out via the comitology procedure. However, this does mean that the European Parliament is completely excluded, as there is no intention to amend the initial legislative text.</p>
<p class="text-left">No comitology procedure has been laid down for these two directives, so there is no reason to adopt the annexes separately.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Economic and Social Committee notes, in its opinion of 17 October 2001, that there are a number of errors in this proposal:</p>
<p class="text-left">-   Article 21 of Directive 96/92/EC, which is unamended by the proposed amending directive, repeatedly refers to Articles 17 and 18 of Directive 96/92/EC. However, these articles are deleted in the amending regulation and relate to negotiated access to the system, and to the single buyer procedure respectively. The wording of Article 21 should therefore be adjusted to take account of the amendments proposed by the Commission relating to the system of access by third parties to the network.</p>
<p class="text-left">-   References left over from the original Directive 98/30/EC which no longer make sense in the amended wording.</p>
<p class="text-left">Examples include the references to Article 18 in Articles 20(1) and 23(1), relating to the definition of the term 'eligible customer', which make no sense in the new wording.</p>
<p class="text-left">Article 26(1), (2) and (3) refer to Article 18(3), (4) and (6) which have been dropped in the amended version. Article 25 refers to Article 16, which has also been deleted.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   Access to the network by third parties</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The majority of the Member States have introduced a system of regulated access to the network because this is the best way of preventing possible abuse of a dominant position on the market. In the case of electricity the Commission does away with negotiated access to the system (points 15 and 16 of the proposal) and introduces a single system of access to the network on the basis of published tariffs (Article 16, new version).</p>
<p class="text-left">In the case of gas, the Member States' freedom to choose between negotiated access and regulated access to the network is formally maintained (Articles 14 and 15 of the new version), but subject to the condition that the regulatory authority approves the tariffs for access to the networks (Article 22, new version).</p>
<p class="text-left">Your draftsman is able to support this position.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>3.</strong>   Regulatory authority</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">There is no sign of resistance to the institution of national regulatory authorities, precisely because the privatisation of the telecommunications market has taken place, one may say successfully, in all Member States under the supervision of very efficient regulatory authorities. Even in the USA, each state has its own regulatory authority.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are lessons to be learnt from the Californian energy crisis which might influence the European regulations.</p>
<p class="text-left">Almost a year after the energy crisis in California, it seems to be clear that electricity suppliers had gone so far as to withdraw electricity from the market in order to keep the price artificially high. A California Senate commission is currently looking at accusations to this effect.</p>
<p class="text-left">The measures taken by the regulatory authority CPUC were successful, the prices have been brought back into equilibrium and supplies have now been secured.</p>
<p class="text-left">The directives on the liberalisation of telecommunications services and the rules on the use of railway infrastructure incorporated a right of appeal against decisions of the regulatory authorities. Here too the Member States should provide for procedures for challenging decisions before a body independent of the national regulatory authority and/or a court.</p>

Under these circumstances, it is in the European Union's interests as far as possible to ensure effective and non-discriminatory access to natural gas production markets for all operators in the European energy industry. Extending the principles of the internal energy market (reciprocity, transparency, fair access to networks, competition) as far as possible to countries which possess raw materials, will contribute to developing producer countries and will help achieve the objectives of the internal market. Giving more European companies access to resources will increase competition in the Community.</em></p><p class="text-left"><em>Energy cooperation with Russia and the partnership policy pursued with the Mediterranean countries are positive examples of efforts to gradually align the legal frameworks of producer and consumer countries.

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The liberalisation of the internal market in energy seeks to open up the electricity and natural gas markets by progressively introducing competition and thus improving efficiency in the energy sector and the competitiveness of the European economy in general. In the course of this liberalisation of the internal market in energy the Member States and the European Union are required to safeguard the interests of the general public and to seek to achieve environmental policy goals and security of supply. To this effect the liberalisation of the internal market in energy has to take account of Directive 77/2001/EC on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market and the White Paper on energy for the future: renewable sources of energy, which seeks to double the share of renewable sources of energy from 6 to 12%.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Grid access</strong> is the key to opening up markets: non-discriminatory, transparent and fair grid access for all market operators is necessary. As renewables make a large contribution to the achievement of Community environmental objectives and, by virtue of their decentralised production, reduce energy import dependence and thus increase security of supply, priority grid access for renewable energy sources must be mandatory in all Member States.</p>
<p class="text-left">Alongside the liberalisation of the internal market in energy specific measures need to be taken to ensure <strong>security of supply</strong> and to avoid the situation which arose in California. Basic supply and the right to a supply of energy of a specific quality at reasonable prices must therefore be guaranteed. In view of the EU's present dependence of 50%, which is set to rise to 70% by 2020 if nothing is done about it<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part10_ref1" href="#_part10_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 10.1">[1]</a>, it is vitally important to expand the role of renewable sources of energy in the European Union. </p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission notes that full competition might mean that electricity from new and less-developed energy sources (e.g. renewables and combined heat and power) became less attractive. In its Green Paper on security of supply<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part10_ref2" href="#_part10_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 10.2">[2]</a> the Commission also points out that demand for electricity could increase by 20% as a result of lower prices. <strong>Public service obligations,</strong> relating in particular to environmental protection and which lay down tariff structures for electricity bills designed to increase energy efficiency, should therefore, in view of the 18% potential for saving energy in the European Union as calculated by the Commission<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part10_ref3" href="#_part10_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 10.3">[3]</a> be mandatory in the Member States.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission's proposal to '<strong>label</strong>' electricity is to be welcomed. In an open market the consumer for his protection must have the right to be informed of the mix of sources of energy he consumes. It is important to monitor the electricity and gas market to ensure that the completion of the internal market in energy does not hold back the development of environmentally friendly technologies in the fields of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, as noted by the Commission. Commission schemes for internalising external costs should be rapidly implemented to remove distortions of competition in a fully open market.</p>
