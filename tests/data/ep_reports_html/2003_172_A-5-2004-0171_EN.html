<p class="text-left">Sustainable development is one of the principal objectives of the European Union (see Article 2 of the EU Treaty and Article 6 of the EC Treaty). Any measure designed to reduce the adverse impact of products on the environment throughout the life of those products must be encouraged.</p>
<p class="text-left">We should, therefore, welcome this Commission proposal for a <em>directive on establishing eco‑design requirements for energy-using products.</em></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission has made eco-design into one of the three major pillars of its Integrated Product Policy (IPP) strategy, the other two being the polluter-pays principle and enlightened consumer choice.</p>
<p class="text-left">In itself, this concept is not really new. Environmental management systems were established in the 1990s in some undertakings so as to take account, as early as the design stage, of the environmental impact of the entire life cycle of the product: from the cradle to the grave. The entire <strong>aim of eco-design </strong>is to integrate environmental considerations at the stage when the technical possibilities for so doing are at a maximum. It is estimated that more than 80% of environmental pollution is determined at the manufacturing stage of a product, the stage at which 90% of the costs arise for the manufacturer.</p>
<p class="text-left">In short, eco-design is frequently advantageous to the manufacturer. Knowing and optimising the flow of raw materials and energy, anticipating and complying with environmental legislation, responding to customers' expectations and, above all, increasing consumer confidence in the products are all advantages which the manufacturer may enjoy as a result of pursuing this preventive approach.</p>
<p class="text-left">Consumers will also benefit. If they are properly informed (which is rarely the case, as we shall see later on), they may, in the long term, derive from eco-designed products a financial benefit since, although such products may initially be more expensive at the time of purchase (for example energy‑efficient light bulbs), they also last longer and enable the purchaser to cut expenditure on energy when using them.</p>
<p class="text-left">From a more general point of view, the eco-design approach offers a number of potential advantages for current and, above all, for future generations. It must be encouraged like any instance of common sense applied to a genuine concern: the environment, first of all with this proposal for a framework directive the <strong>scope</strong> of which is very exhaustive. All energy sources are covered, even if it is likely that only products using electricity and solid, liquid or gaseous fuels will be the subject of binding follow-up action. The scope also covers replacement parts intended for end users. On the other hand, motor vehicles are excluded therefrom because they are already covered by other regulatory measures.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur agrees with the scope selected which seeks to apply IPP concepts to <strong>a vast range of products which are responsible for about 40% of CO</strong><sub><strong>2</strong></sub><strong> emissions into the atmosphere.</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The choice of the legal instrument - <strong>a framework directive which does not establish any immediate obligations </strong>- seems appropriate. That said, the fact of having the implementing measures taken in respect of certain energy-using products adopted under the comitology procedure is not to your rapporteur's taste. Of course, the codecision procedure is not appropriate in instances where swift and effective action is required. On the other hand, industry and the NGOs active in the environmental field must be allowed to have their say. That is why your rapporteur proposes the <strong>establishment of a Consultative Committee upstream of the comitology procedure</strong>, along the lines of the one established by the Eco-labelling Regulation.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nevertheless, your rapporteur is highly critical of some fundamental points in this proposal. This text includes objectives which are not clear but does not include a timetable for the selection of the products in respect of which environmental performance must be rapidly improved.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur has decided not to draw up a positive list of the products to be covered by implementing measures ('Commission directives') because she realises that this approach might be regarded as a blank cheque by various industrial sectors not referred to by name. By contrast, the drawing up of <strong>an indicative list of products</strong> is a halfway house solution which will help the Commission in its work. That indicative list, based on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, includes eight categories of products including electric motor systems (an estimated potential reduction of 39 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>), office equipment (an estimated potential reduction of 34 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>) and electricity used by audio and video equipment in standby mode (1% of world emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p class="text-left">Another point of disagreement with the Commission concerns <strong>conformity assessment</strong>. Your rapporteur is not satisfied with the situation currently obtaining: manufacturers' making their own declaration of conformity for most products placed on the market. Of course, we do not wish to station a policeman behind every product placed on the market, that would be unrealistic. However, your rapporteur seeks to strengthen the <strong>role of independent notified bodies</strong>, with particular regard to products which, by their intrinsic properties, present a risk to human health. The ball is also in the court of the national control authorities who must significantly increase the number of product tests.</p>
<p class="text-left">Still on the subject of product control, your rapporteur has some doubts about the immediate extension of CE marking to energy-using products which comply with eco-design requirements. Numerous studies, including a very recent one, the findings of which were published in October 2003, have revealed shortcomings in the system. At all events, <strong>CE marking</strong> does not provide a guarantee of the safety of a particular product.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Amendment 69 to Annex III</strong> responds to this concern by asking the Commission to draw up a report on compliance by manufacturers and distributors with safety standards which entitles them to affix CE markings to their products.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur also hopes that this proposal will improve the <strong>dissemination and visibility of the EMAS scheme</strong>, an important tool for IPP which the European Parliament supported massively in the vote taken in plenary on 14 February 2001.</p>
<p class="text-left">Furthermore, it is essential that this proposal for a framework directive involves the general public. <strong>Your rapporteur notes that the principal absentees from this text are, firstly, consumers and, secondly, small undertakings and very small firms,</strong> which do, however, constitute essential links in the economic chain and play an important role in the life cycle of a product.</p>
<p class="text-left">The European Parliament clearly stated its position on SMUs and very small firms in its resolution of 17 January 2002 on the Green Paper devoted to IPP: the cost of the measures must be reduced in order not to exclude them from the process, and there is a case for establishing environmental indicators based on an assessment of the simplified life cycle of products. In line with that position your rapporteur calls on the <strong>Commission to establish a database</strong> in order to facilitate the incorporation of the life-cycle approach and eco-design into their activities.</p>
<p class="text-left">Finally your rapporteur proposes a whole series of tools seeking to raise consumer awareness about the need to avoid energy-wasting and, more generally, about environmental protection. To that end, it is essential for the Member States to draw up <strong>a guide entitled 'Energy Hints</strong>'.</p>

<p><strong class="text-left">Subject:   <em>Legal basis of the proposal for a Directive establishing a framework for the setting of Eco-design requirements for Energy-using products and amending Council Directive (COM(2003) 453 - 2003/0172(COD) – C5‑0369/2003)</em></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Mrs Jackson,</p>
<p class="text-left">By letter of 29 January 2004 you requested the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, under Rule 63(2), to consider the issue of the appropriate legal basis for the above proposal. You did so because, while the Commission had based its proposal on Article 95 of the EC Treaty, some Members of your Committee took the view that the correct legal basis should be Article 175 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market considered the above question at its meeting of 23 February 2004.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is essentially asked to verify the choice of the appropriate legal basis for the measure which the Commission proposes and, in particular, on whether it should be founded on Article 95 or Article 175 of the EC Treaty. Both Article 95 EC and Article 175 EC lay down the co-decision procedure.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is clear from settled case law of the ECJ that the choice of the legal basis does not depend on the discretion of the Community legislature but must be based on objective elements which are amenable to judicial control. Among these elements are, in particular, the aim and the content of the legal act.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref1" href="#_part7_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.1">[1]</a> In practice, the Court bases its findings essentially on the recitals stated in the preamble.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is also necessary to determine whether the measures in question relate principally to a particular field of action, having only incidental effects on other policies, or whether both aspects are equally essential. If the first hypothesis is correct, recourse to a single legal basis is sufficient<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref2" href="#_part7_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.2">[2]</a>; if the second is correct, it is insufficient<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref3" href="#_part7_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.3">[3]</a> and the institution is required to adopt the measure on the basis of both of the provisions from which its competence derives.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref4" href="#_part7_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.4">[4]</a> However, no such dual basis is possible where the procedures laid down for each legal basis are incompatible with each other.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref5" href="#_part7_def5" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.5">[5]</a></p>
<p class="text-left">In the present case, application of those criteria amounts to asking whether the draft Directive, in the light of its context, its aim and its content, constitutes an act principally concerning environmental protection which is liable to have incidental effects on the internal market, whether, conversely, it is principally an act concerning internal market which incidentally takes account of certain environmental requirements, or whether it is inextricably concerned both with environmental protection and with internal market.</p>
<p class="text-left">Energy using product is defined in the draft Directive as a "product which is dependent on energy input (electricity, fossil and renewable fuels) to work as intended and a product for the generation, transfer and measurement of such energy, including parts which are intended to be incorporated into energy using products which are placed on the market as individual parts for end-users, the environmental performance of which can be assessed independently" (Article 2, second paragraph of the draft Directive).</p>
<p class="text-left">Eco-design means "the systematic integration of environmental aspects into product design with the aim to improve the environmental performance of the energy using product throughout its whole life cycle" (Article 2, paragraph 20 of the draft Directive).</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal seeks to contribute "to sustainable development by increasing security of energy supply and by aiming at a high level of environmental protection" (Article 1, second paragraph of the draft Directive).</p>
<p class="text-left">The content of the proposed Directive consists of establishing a framework for the integration of environmental aspects in product design and development to ensure the free movement of energy-using products within the internal market (Article 1, paragraph 1, first subparagraph of the draft Directive). Accordingly, the proposed Directive provides for the definition of requirements which the energy using products covered by implementing measures must fulfil with a view to their placing on the market (Article 1, paragraph 1, second subparagraph of the draft Directive).</p>
<p class="text-left">As regards the aim of the draft Directive, it must be observed that, according to its first recital, it is intended to harmonise existing national laws and administrative measures as regards the eco-design of energy using products.</p>
<p class="text-left">The third recital states that a "coherent framework for the application of Community eco-design requirements for energy using products should be established with the aim of ensuring the free movement of those products which comply and of improving their overall environmental impact".</p>
<p class="text-left">Recital 9 mentions that "energy using products complying with the eco-design requirements laid down in implementing measures to this Directive should bear the “CE” marking and associated information, in order to enable them to be put on the internal market and move freely."</p>
<p class="text-left">Recital 12 reinforces that it "is in the interest of the functioning of the internal market to have standards which have been harmonised at Community level."</p>
<p class="text-left">As regards the environment, the fourth recital states that the proposed Directive "seeks to achieve a high level of protection for the environment by improving resource efficiency of energy using products, which will ultimately be beneficial to consumers and other end users".</p>
<p class="text-left">The draft Directive "contributes to sustainable development by increasing security of energy supply and by aiming at a high level of environmental protection" (Article 1, paragraph 1, second subparagraph of the draft Directive). Its fourth recital that "Sustainable development also requires proper consideration of the health, social and economic impact of the measures envisaged".</p>
<p class="text-left">The fifth recital mentions the objective of reducing the environmental impact of products at design stage. The sixth recital admits that eco-design requirements for some products or environmental aspects thereof may be needed "in order to ensure that their environmental impact is minimised. Such priority measures should be introduced taking into account, in particular, their potential for reducing greenhouse gases emissions at low cost. Such measures can contribute to the achievement of the goal set in the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changes (UNFCCC)"<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref6" href="#_part7_def6" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.6">[6]</a>. </p>
<p class="text-left">It is true that numerous provisions of the draft Directive relate specifically to the environment. However, the fact remains that, as shown by the above considerations, the draft Directive is, in the light of its aim and its content, an instrument intended essentially to harmonise the legislation of the Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="text-left">It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that adoption of the Directive must be founded on a single legal basis, specific to the internal market. Consequently, Article 95 of the EC Treaty, is the appropriate legal basis.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market thus unanimously decided<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref7" href="#_part7_def7" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.7">[7]</a> that Article 95 of the EC Treaty is the appropriate legal basis.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="text-left">Giuseppe Gargani</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission's proposal for a EuP Directive establishing Eco-Design requirements for energy using products is to be welcomed as an overdue attempt to maximize resource (above all energy) efficiency of products. A more intelligent use of energy could save up to 40 % of current energy demand! It thus constitutes the biggest and cheapest way for the EU to fulfil its Kyoto commitment (-8 % by 2010 compared to 1990's CO 2 emissions).</p>
<p class="text-left">There is a real need for <strong>legislation tackling the demand-side</strong> of energy, highlighted again with the recent spate of <strong>blackouts</strong> in the US and Europe. The inherent logic of a <strong>liberalized</strong> energy market does not bring about investments in energy savings due to a market imperfection where full transparency and information is not given or requires considerable transaction costs.</p>
<p class="text-left">The EU wants to become the most competitive economy by 2010. A cost efficient win-win strategy for competitiveness and environment would be to become the most energy efficient economy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Reality in fact shows that EU is lagging behind other economies such as the US, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Canada and even China in a number of aspects of efficiency policy design and ambition. But the longer we wait with our policy responses, the more likely it is that the other impose their standards first and EU-25 misses its chance to transform the global market for appliances.</p>
<p class="text-left">Incomprehensibly, this did not push EU Commission to come forward with an ambitious proposal for the promotion of best available technology appliances, heating, office equipment and industry end-use equipment. On the contrary the EuP-Directive seems to have lost its clarity and ambition when two previous directives were merged.</p>
<p class="text-left">This induced your draftsman to re-establish clear priority for energy efficiency for requirements within the context of this directive without necessarily giving up the integrated policy approach.</p>
<p class="text-left">Amendments have been inspired by experience in other countries and comparative analysis by the IEA, especially the US approach and the <strong>least life cycle cost principl</strong>e that allows for improvements at negative cost for society, the <strong>independent third party verification </strong>and<strong> independent third party analysis/monitoring which </strong>is a better option for a sector that requires detailed knowledge and substantial transaction costs.</p>
<p class="text-left">The creation of a strategic and independent agency has proven to be successful in other countries. The Executive Agency of the Intelligent Energy for Europe Program and its budget shall fulfil these tasks in the EU, thus there is no need to ask for additional resources.</p>
<p class="text-left">Key factors for success are <strong>minimum energy performance requirements</strong> for all mayor end-uses, complemented by credible and dynamic labeling. This can only be done with <strong>Specific requirements (Annex II)</strong>. <strong>Generic requirements </strong>(Annex I ) would be decided by manufacturers only and make it very difficult to establish a level playing field and legal certainty. In cases where standard setting is not feasible, other ways to transform the market shall be implemented such as incentive-based approaches, quantitative targets, awareness campaigns etc.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whereas the draftsman did decide not to put a definitive<strong> list of products</strong> to be tackled with implementing measures, there is a need for the EP to define certain conditions and a timetable for the choice of targeted products: Implementing measures shall be proposed first for products that have been identified as priorities in the ECCP. <strong>Standby power ( </strong>account for 1% of COs emissions worldwide<strong>)</strong> is explicitly mentioned as a horizontal measure though because it is the category with the highest savings potential. Your draftsman is not opposed to <strong>Voluntary agreements</strong> in general, but calls for them to be monitored and backed-up with command-and-control-alternatives.</p>
<p class="text-left">Finally, the legislative and monitoring role of the EP has to be improved significantly before giving to Comitology the decision on implementing measures. Not all implementing measures have to pass a lengthy co-decision procedure, however the Commission's draft deprives the EP of any decision. A good compromise between democratic scrutiny and efficiency is a <strong>pre-comitology Advisory Committee process</strong> like the one set up in the context of the Eco-Label Board.</p>
