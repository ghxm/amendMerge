<p><u>Introduction</u></p>
<p>In these proposals, the Commission stresses the importance of freedom of access to shipping markets across the world, the need to raise the quality standards of international shipping while ensuring a wide range of highly competitive shipping services.  The Commission states that good progress has been made in these areas; however, the situation of Community seafarers employment has worsened in the last decades, the employment trend going down continuously.  This situation is the result mainly of flagging out, labour saving measures and cheaper labour from third countries.  The cargo sector seems to be more heavily influenced by these changes but the trend could spread to the passenger ferry sector.</p>
<p>Measures to promote the employment of Community seafarers include a Community policy on state aid, aiming at removing the incentives for flagging out on one hand and harmonising the market conditions for the employment of seafarers working in regular passenger lines between Member States and mainly between ports and islands if the same Member State on the other; the later case represents not only the center of gravity and the bulk of maritime passenger transport in the EU but also the highest percentage of employment for seafarers (almost 50% of all Member States' seafaring personnel).</p>
<p><u>The proposals</u></p>
<p>Following this analysis, the Commission proposes to amend the 1992 Regulation (CEEC) N° 3577/92)<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part4_ref1" href="#_part4_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 4.1">[1]</a> on maritime cabotage to ensure that third country seafarers employed on regular passenger and ferry services, mixed passenger services and scheduled cruise services, receive equal treatment with Community seafarers eliminating thus any possibility for social dumping.  This provision is to be viewed in conjunction with Article 1 of the same Regulation which stipulates the freedom to provide maritime transport services within a Member State to Community shipowners who have their ships registered in, and flying the flag of a Member State.</p>
<p>The second proposal is a specific Directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States.  The aim is equally to ensure equal treatment (labour conditions) for all seafarers employed in these lines, wether they are residents of Member States or not.  The proposed Directive will specifically apply to vessels under third country flags.  In addition, there is provision for derogations for exceptional circumstances, as an unforeseen change of a member(s) of crew.</p>
<p><u>Remarks</u></p>
<p>. Although there should be a clear distinction between the cabotage issue (first proposal) and the Directive on nationality of manning in intra-EU passenger and ferry services proposal), the presentation of both issues under the same document together with a Communication applying to both does not contribute either to clarity or to legal certainty.</p>
<p>In addition, the 1992 Regulation (EEC 3577/92) was the result of a difficult compromise not only between Member States but also within the maritime industry.  The same differences of views still exist and they cannot be overcome by working on a new compromise based on the new Directive on manning, as seems to be the intention of the Commission.</p>
<p>Equally, the proposed Directive seems to create serious concern within the industry as it implies a direct intervention in the labour market which could be considered contrary to the freedom of trade and services.  Further, as the Directive would apply also to any EU-owned ship registered outside the Community as well as to sea areas between Member States which are considered international waters, a number of questions concerning the compatibility of this Directive with EU and Member States international commitments as well as with international law and international Conventions.</p>
<p>Our committee has asked Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee and Parliament's legal service to examine these questions before the Parliament adopts this proposal as the EU joint decisionmaking authority.</p>
<p>There are a number of additional considerations and problems which require a definite solution before any EU law on manning of regular passenger and ferry services between Member States can be considered such as the way to implement uniform working conditions when some Member States have double registers.</p>
<p>The connection between safety at sea and qualified and well trained crew is more than proved and the European Parliament has long insisted on the need of EU measures to ensure employment and good training for Community seafarers which the Commission has not always welcomed.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part4_ref2" href="#_part4_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 4.2">[2]</a></p>
<p>One of the stated aims of the proposed Directive is to create a level playing field between EU competitors as well as to safeguard employment.  As labour conditions are in real terms divergent in the different Member States, it is difficult to see the practical impact of the proposed measures.  Moreover, the difficulties of the ferry services foreseen as a consequence of the abolition of duty free sales can not be compensated by establishing uniform working conditions.  The proposal might stop the employment of cheap labour but it can not safeguard the continuation of the services or employment.</p>
<p><u>Conclusions</u></p>
<p>There seems to be no valid reason to amend now the 1992 Regulation for passenger services. This version is already forseen for 2001, in addition the report submitted by the Commission  in 1995 on the basis of this Regulation proposed changes which were optional and not endorsed in legal obligation, as is the case with this proposal.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur proposes, therefore, to keep the status quo of the 1992 Regulation and not to amend it until a further study has been made on the impact of the proposed liberalization of regular passenger and ferry services between Member States (amendment 4). The need to conduct an impact study is also stressed in the framework of the Directive on manning.</p>
<p>As for the Directive on manning, greater efforts at EU level should aim on increasing the sector's competitiveness by actively promoting high quality shipping standards.  Measures to promote training and maritime know-how are essential elements of this strategy .</p>

<p>(Rule 147)</p>
<p>for the Committee on Transport</p>
<p>on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) (COM(98)0251 - C4-0423/98 - 98/0158(SYN)), and on the proposal for a Council Directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States (COM(98)0251  - C4-0424/98 - 98/0159(SYN))  (report by Mrs McIntosh)</p>
<p>Committee on Employment and Social Affairs</p>
<p>Draftsman: Mr Friedrich Wolf</p>
<p><u><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></u></p>
<p>At its meeting of 23 September 1998 the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs appointed Mr Wolf draftsman.</p>
<p>It considered the draft opinion at its meeting of 10 November 1998.</p>
<p>At the latter meeting it adopted the following conclusions unanimously, with 1 abstention.</p>
<p>The following took part in the vote : Hughes, chairman; Ojala, vice-chairman; Wolf, draftsman;  Andersson, Castagnetti, Chanterie, Ghilardotti (for Carnitit), Glase, Hermange, Jöns, Papakyriazia (for Peter), Pronk, Ramos, Schörling, van Velzen, Van Lancker, Waddington and Weiler</p>
<p><u><strong>I Background</strong></u></p>
<p>One of the main objectives of the common maritime policy is to promote the employment of welltrained Community seafarers. This objective has been stressed <em>inter alia </em>by the Council of the  Resolution on a new strategy to increase the competitiveness of Community shipping<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref1" href="#_part5_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.1">[1]</a> which was preceded by the adoption of the Commission Communication "Towards a new maritime strategy" by the European Parliament<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref2" href="#_part5_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The employment of European seafarers is however in decline. Some of the reasons are out-flagging, replacement of Community crew by cheaper labour from third countries, and technical labour-saving rationalisation measures.  So far the personnel intensive passenger-ferry sector is relatively unharmed by this trend. This is in part due to the exemptions provided for this sector in the Council regulation  No. 3577/92, which liberalises the provision of maritime services in the common market.</p>
<p>Together with its Communication, the Commission proposes two regulatory documents. On the one hand, a regulatory framework is proposed for passenger services between member states. On the other hand, a Regulation is proposed which would amend the special provisions which Council Regulation No 3577/92 makes for manning conditions in the framework of maritime service liberalisation. As the social and economic consequences of these two proposals differ substantially, they should be treated differently.</p>
<p><u><strong>II The need for a comprehensive approach in order to achieve a common space for maritime services in the Union</strong></u></p>
<p>The Committee for Employment and Social Affairs welcomes strongly the Commission"s intention, declared in the framework of its maritime strategy, to foster training and recruitment and the development of job opportunities for EU seafarers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the committee welcomes the overall aim of the Commission to install a level playing field for all providers of ferry services in the EU. As passenger trade between member states has todate not been regulated at EU level, the proposed regulation represents  substantial progress in this respect while taking into account the need for an adequate level of social protection and working conditions. It can therefore only be welcomed.</p>
<p>However, the approach chosen by the Commission in the field of cabotage markets for ferry services within member states is problematic and should be altered. It consists in allowing vessels from other member states than the host state where the ferry service is provided - step by step - to apply the rules of their own flag instead of those of the host state.</p>
<p>Ferry services within member states are not a uniform good being produced at one place and being exported all over the Union. On the contrary, these services are locally bound. Ferries involved in these services are normally specificly equiped and manned for their purpose. The application of the rules of the host state as to the manning of these ferries is therefore an obvious and adequate principle. Insofar as the application of the host state"s rules concerning social and employment conditions of the crew represent to a relevant degree an barrier to providers from other EU member states, EU-wide harmonisation of these rules should be sought to achieve.</p>
<p>A common space for maritime services throughout the Union should be the ultimate aim of this harmonisation process. Such a common space must include adequate provisions concerning employment, training, social protection and working conditions. This aim can be better achieved through a consistent attempt to set up relevant EU regulations than through an approach allowing all EU ships to apply their own country"s rules  even for cabotage services within other EU countries.</p>
<p><u><strong>III Cabotage within Member States</strong></u></p>
<p>Following the Commission"s proposal for amending the Council Regulation No 3577/92, the host state could apply it"s rules concerning the required proportion of EU nationals in the crew. It is to be welcomed that the proposal provides for the equal treatment of third-country nationals and EU nationals concerning the terms and conditions of their employment on board these vessels. It is also to be welcomed that scheduled cruise services are included in the draft.</p>
<p>However, for all aspects of manning conditions other than regarding nationality, the rules of the flag state would apply. This changes substantially the previous rules concerning manning. Distorted competition to the detriment of social and working conditions of the crew can be a  consequence of this substantial change, where the manning rules of a Community flag ship differ from those of the host state to which local providers are subject.</p>
<p>In order to assess the potential consequences of this change, the Commission has at the request of the Council elaborated a report on the economic and social impact of the liberalisation of island cabotage (COM (97)296 fin.). It was only on this basis that the Commission"s proposal for amending the Council Regulation no 3577/92 might include changes concerning the manning rules of ferry services. Yet, this report does not provide sufficient information for the proper assessment of the consequences of the envisaged changes.</p>
<p>Until a satisfactory solution is found by way of harmonisation, current exemptions should not be abolished, as this could have a serious negative impact on the social conditions and the  employment situation of European seafarers on inland ferries.</p>
<p><u><strong>IV Passenger services between Member states</strong></u></p>
<p>As stated above, the fact that a regulatory framework for ferry and passenger services is to be installed represents a substantial improvement compared to the current situation.</p>
<p>This framework is all the more necessary as the abolition of duty free shopping will probably lead to a sharp decline in passenger numbers on some ferry lines. In this connection, the fact that the large majority of ferries operating between member states is manned with EU nationals - often local seafarers -, could change, due to fierce competition between providers striving for their economic survival.</p>
<p>The proposed directive offers a reasonable set of provisions concerning social and working conditions of the crew, thus contributing to the prevention of dumping competion from service providers using a flag of convenience, and can be fully supported.</p>
<p>However, in order to rule out any possibility of social dumping resulting from socio-economic differences between EU countries, a similar regulatory structure as for the posting of workers should be installed. The exemption made in the Directive 96/71/EC (concerning posting of workers) for merchant navy undertakings does not take into account the particularities of regular ferry services operating between member states.</p>
<p><u><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></u></p>
<p>The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes the Proposal for a Council Directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States and calls on the Committee on Transport, as the committee responsible, to incorporate in its report the following amendment concerning the proposed Council Regulation amending Council Regulation No 3577/92 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage):</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless mb-0"><tr class="text-center"><td><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless mb-0"><tr class="text-center"><td class="w-50 align-top">
