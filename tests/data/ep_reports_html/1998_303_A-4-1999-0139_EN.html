<p><strong>The proposal for a regulation: summary and comments</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of the Commission proposal is to update Regulation 1863/93 of 29 June 1993 on voluntary participation by industry in a Community eco-management and audit scheme. The introduction to the Commission proposal outlines the results achieved by the present EMAS scheme and indicates the strong points and weaknesses of the system so that it can be revised.</p>
<p>2. The regulation entered into force in 1993. Almost all Member States took steps to identify the competent bodies and control bodies and make them operational, thus opening the way for participation in EMAS.</p>
<p>3. The most recent statistics are not very encouraging from a strictly numerical point of view, but the quality of the results should be emphasised. The regulation has had a major impact on the relationship between environmental policy and industrial development. The voluntary nature of participation in EMAS is undoubtedly the crux of this innovative approach which it is now intended to consolidate with the revision proposed.</p>
<p>4. Some 40 pilot projects were launched by the Commission to encourage participation by industry in EMAS; as from 1996 another 10 were launched for the sake of small and medium-sized undertakings and 6 concerned non-industrial economic sectors. These pilot projects were funded under budget heading B-3040.</p>
<p>5. In 1996 ISO standard 14001 became applicable world-wide without prejudice to EMAS, which continued to remain valid to all effects. EMAS does not however supersede the ISO standard but is more advanced as an environmental policy instrument. Participation in EMAS is however voluntary and was conceived in such a way as not to be an obstacle to the freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment within the internal market. Nor is EMAS an obstacle to free trade world-wide. The proposal makes a point of clarifying the compatibility between the ISO standard and the European eco-management and environmental audit system.</p>
<p>6. The innovations introduced by the proposal include extension of the scope to all economic sectors (Parliament had adopted an amendment to this effect). The term 'organisation' is proposed to include all the economic entities concerned. The concept of site which so far has been used to define the industrial area in which EMAS applied will also be adapted to new potential participants.</p>
<p>7. Another important innovation proposed by the Commission is the involvement of dependents. This is an important factor. The involvement of clients and consumers will also have to be improved without however burdening the organisations.</p>
<p>8. The dissemination of EMAS will depend to a great extent on the degree of involvement of the economic actors in the production chains (suppliers and distributors). Participation by economic actors upstream and downstream of the organisation concerned, or of the producer of goods and services, that have decided to participate in EMAS will have to be encouraged.</p>
<p>9. The success of EMAS will also depend on greater involvement of local actors and interested parties: contractors, associations of SMUs, public administrations, regional economic development bodies and others interested.</p>
<p>10. Consideration should therefore be given to new means of promoting the European eco-management and audit system, including for instance the possibility of introducing a national tax for the benefit of participating organisations or priority access to public financial concessions under regional and national laws, including those provided for by the Structural Funds or other headings in the Community budget.</p>
<p>11. In conclusion, the proposal for a regulation is undoubtedly positive, and the rapporteur appreciates the work done by the Commission. The changes proposed serve their purpose and should permit a significant dissemination of EMAS throughout Europe. Your rapporteur, who drew up the report on the proposal for Regulation 1863/93 for the European Parliament, welcomes the results achieved by the Community rules in recent years and is satisfied that the Commission has finally included some of the amendments previously tabled in its amended proposal. Your rapporteur merely reserves the right to propose some amendments in order to ensure better promotion of EMAS at national level in full compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>

<p>on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a community eco-management and audit scheme (COM(98)0622 - C4-0683/98 - 98/0303(SYN))  (report Valverde López)</p>
<p>Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy</p>
<p>Draftsperson: Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer</p>
<p><u><strong>Procedure</strong></u></p>
<p>At its meeting of 7 December 1998 the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy appointed Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer draftsman.</p>
<p>It considered the draft opinion at its meetings of 26 January, 18 February and 23 February 1999.</p>
<p>At the last meeting it adopted the following conclusions unanimously.</p>
<p>The following were present for the vote: von Wogau, chairman; Garosci and Secchi, vice-chairmen; Anttila (for Cox), Areitio Toledo, Arroni, Berès, Camisón Asensio (for García-Margallo y Marfil), Carrozzo, Cassidy (for Mather), Caudron, Cunningham (for Murphy), Fayot, Fourçans, Harrison, Hendrick, Herman, Hoppenstedt, Ilaskivi, Jarzembowski (for Konrad), Kuckelkorn, Langen, Metten, Miller, Paasilinna, Peijs, Porto (for de Brémond d'Ars), Randzio-Plath, Rapkay, Read, Rübig, Svensson, Thyssen, Watson.</p>
<p><u><strong>Background</strong></u></p>
<p>EMAS, the eco-management and audit scheme, established by Council Regulation No 1836/93 allowing voluntary participation by companies in the industrial sector, came into force  in July 1993.</p>
<p>According to the present regulation the objectives of EMAS are:</p>
<p>- to improve environmental performance;</p>
<p>- to demonstrate compliance with environmental legislation;</p>
<p>- to communicate environmental achievements to the public.</p>
<p>Participation in the scheme requires the economic operator to:</p>
<p>- define its environmental policy;</p>
<p>- review its environmental effects and performance;</p>
<p>- establish an environmental programme, containing targets for continuous improvement, and an environmental management system;</p>
<p>- conduct environmental audits, in order to monitor the results of its activities and the achievement of the set goals;</p>
<p>- produce an environmental statement available to the public, to share with the company"s stakeholders all relevant environmental information.</p>
<p>The text of the  regulation is now under revision, as required by its Article 20. The main elements considered in the proposal for revision are:</p>
<p>- to extend the scope of EMAS to all economic activities having significant environmental impact;</p>
<p>- to underline the compatibility of EMAS with ISO 14001, by including ISO 14001 as the environmental management system component of  EMAS;</p>
<p>- to enhance the employees involvement, in order to allow them to contribute actively to the implementation of EMAS;</p>
<p>- to define a logo that can be used by EMAS registered companies as a more visible sign of  EMAS participation, and therefore lead to a wider recognition from the market;</p>
<p>- to enhance the promotion strategy of EMAS, ensuring that consistent information is made available across Member States;</p>
<p>- to make more frequent external verifications (yearly);</p>
<p>- to increase the importance of the environmental statement, as the EMAS external communication element and the main contact with the company"s stakeholders;</p>
<p>- to improve the credibility of verifiers, through defined criteria of competence and increased supervision of the verifiers themselves;</p>
<p>- to modify the existing site-based registration, in order to include all types of economic activities and to be compatible with ISO 14001.</p>
<p><strong>The position of your draftsperson</strong></p>
<p>Your draftsperson welcomes the revision of the EMAS regulation. Several of the Commission's proposal will improve the regulation. These include the extension of the scope of EMAS to all economic activities, the enhancement of employees' involvement, more frequent external verifications, the increased importance of the environmental statement, improved credibility of verifiers, the modification of the existing site-based registration  and the enhancement of a promotion strategy for EMAS.</p>
<p>The EMAS scheme will become an important element in promoting environmental performance in industry and services. Although participation in EMAS is presently at a disappointingly low level of participation (by the end of August 1998 there were 1787 registered sites in 13 Member States and Norway, of which more than two thirds came from Germany) it is important to provide to enterprises, who are willing to improve their environmental record, an environmental management scheme. In the long run it will be an important competitive advantage to have an EMAS registration. According to a Commission poll among EMAS participants, the top three benefits cited by all registered sites were cost savings (31%), better image (29%) and improved employee morale (26%). According to the same poll 94% of all registered sites are going to maintain their registration to EMAS. These figures highlight the untapped potential  provided by EMAS.</p>
<p>In spite of its potential EMAS finds itself at a crossroads. In September 1996 the International Organisation for Standardisation adopted ISO 14001 as the international environmental management system (EMS) standard, three years after the entry into force of EMAS. This standard is applicable world-wide and open to all economic sectors. It is the result of international consensus and stands as an important tool in the field of environmental management schemes. It does not however fulfill all the requirements of EMAS, in particular the publication of an environmental statement. Since its adoption in 1996 the Commission accepted ISO 14001 as a building block for EMAS, as it turned out that many companies subscribed to the international standard. This competition is a crucial factor for the future development of EMAS. Will it be adjusted to the global ISO norm or should it be a more demanding and more credible voluntary instrument. Your draftsperson is in favour of a more demanding EMAS scheme for all those ambitious entrepreneurs who want a label for  quality ecological performance.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments will strengthen EMAS and make it more credible for business partners of EMAS subscribers and for the public at large. It is important that the European Union can offer a quality label for good environmental performance to its economy. The more credible it becomes the more it will find its place in the European and world market. It will be a tool to ensure European leadership in environmental management and sustainable business practice.</p>
<p>Amendment 1:  According to the Commission one or two Member States remain where the basic structures for EMAS have not been set up.  This problem needs to be strongly addressed by the Commission .</p>
<p>Amendment 2: EMAS could be an important competitive tool for companies from countries which have applied for EU-membership.</p>
<p>Amendments 3: Environmental  policy is the commitment of the management and all employees. The regulation should give guidance on what an environmental policy is.</p>
<p>Amendment 4: Continuous improvement on a voluntary basis is one of the main principles of EMAS. Therefore the methods to achieve "continuous improvements" have to be better defined. Technological and organisational improvements have to be introduced, which will strengthen EMAS over ISO.</p>
<p>Amendment 5: It strengthens the communicative value of the environmental statement.</p>
<p>Amendment 6: High registration fees in certain Member States may be one of the reasons for low participation.</p>
<p>Amendment 7: EU funding where appropriate could be one factor to boost SME participation.</p>
<p><u><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></u></p>
<p>For these reasons, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy recommends that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following amendments in its report:</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless mb-0"><tr class="text-center"><td><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless mb-0"><tr class="text-center"><td class="w-50 align-top">
