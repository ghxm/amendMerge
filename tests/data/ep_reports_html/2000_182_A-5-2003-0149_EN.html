<p class="text-left">This proposal forms part of the 'hygiene package' and, as a proposal for a directive repealing the previous legislation, provides the necessary technical addition to the four proposals for a recast of European legislation on food hygiene, animal diseases and official controls on products of animal origin.</p>
<p class="text-left">During the past decades, a total of 17 directives were adopted in this complex area and adapted to requirements. The proposals for three regulations and one directive accompanying the proposal under review bring these 17 directives together in a recast form and above all make them simpler and clearer. Adopting Community provisions in the form of regulations also offers the advantage of uniform application and greater transparency.</p>
<p class="text-left">Two of these proposals have already been considered by the European Parliament at first reading (2000/0178(COD) and 2000/0179(COD)). The third proposal, on official controls (2002/014(COD)), is currently under negotiation in the Environment Committee and should be approved together with the present proposal. Finally, the 'hygiene package' also includes a Council directive on animal-health rules for the production and placing on the market of products of animal origin which the Council has already adopted as Directive 2002/99/EC on 16 December 2002. This package was accompanied by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety, also already adopted.</p>
<p class="text-left">With regard to the proposal repealing previous legislation, which is the subject of the present procedure, it should be pointed out that care must be taken to avoid creating a legal vacuum or provoking any repeal without replacement legislation. Consequently, the directive cannot be adopted until the three codecision procedures still in progress have been concluded, and the current provisions should not be repealed until the new rules have fully entered into force. Article 3 of the proposal should guarantee the necessary legal continuity.</p>
<p class="text-left">Two aspects need to be examined before final adoption of the directive: firstly, whether the proposed version is still compatible with the developments in negotiations on the rest of the package and whether any adjustments need to be made, and secondly, whether the timescale for the implementation of this directive in Article 6(1) is still realistic, depending on the date of adoption of the package as a whole.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is impossible to made any assessment on either aspect at present, and your rapporteur therefore recommends that the Commission proposal be approved without amendment in the version proposed, in order to enable the Council to decide on its common position on the entire package still pending as soon as possible.</p></div><div class="separator separator-dotted separator-2x my-3"></div><h2 id="_section4">OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT</h2><div><p><strong>11 October 2001</strong></p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In order to bring Community legislation into line with the principles governing the hygiene of foodstuffs laid down in the Codex Alimentarius, it is proposed to recast the legislation on food safety. The Commission has presented a set of proposals in this connection comprising four regulations and one directive drawn up on the legal bases of Article 37, 95 and 152 of the Treaty (COM (2000) 438):</p>
<p class="text-left">-   proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs (Article 152, public health);</p>
<p class="text-left">-   proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (Article 152, public health);</p>
<p class="text-left">-   proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down detailed rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (Article 152, public health);</p>
<p class="text-left">-   proposal for a Council regulation laying down the animal-health rules governing the production, placing on the market and importation of products of animal origin intended for human consumption (Article 37, common agricultural policy);</p>
<p class="text-left">-   proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing certain directives on the hygiene of foodstuffs and the health conditions for the production and placing on the market of certain products of animal origin intended for human consumption, and amending Directives 86/662/EEC and 91/67/EEC (Articles 37, common agricultural policy, 95, internal market and 152, public health).</p>
<p class="text-left">The latter proposal for a directive is the direct consequence of the current process of recasting the legislation with the aim of simplifying and making more coherent and transparent the new legislative framework on the hygiene of foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="text-left">We must first of all stress the significance of these radical changes with regard to food safety. It has now been shown that the detailed hygiene rules contained in the current regulations and directives have not protected us from the BSE crisis. As a counterbalance to the dramatic loosening-up of the administrative measures, it is a fundamental requirement for the smooth functioning of this policy that each operator involved in the food chain must be made to bear greater responsibility. It is therefore essential to point out to producers, especially small farmers, that although the focus has been on a deliberate relaxation of the provisions of the legislation in force, this flexibility cannot be taken lightly. Otherwise it would rapidly turn into a poisoned chalice.</p>
<p class="text-left">In addition, Article 6 of the proposal for a directive, which concerns the entry into force of the provisions being recast fixes that date as 1 January 2004. This deadline could be changed by offering a period of time within which the legislation must come into force. Thus certain countries which are already prepared for those measures could set an example by transposing them before the end of that period and encouraging other Member States who are more nervous or anxious about the principles involved. It would be possible to consider implementing the legislation one year after its adoption.</p>

The introduction of codes of good hygiene practice will enable the current special legislation, often regarded as too prescriptive and too rigid, to be made more flexible.

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   Introduction</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Since 1964, in response to the needs of the internal market and the necessity for high levels of protection, 17 different Council Directives have been adopted and developed to cover the areas of food hygiene and public health, official controls on products of animal origin and the animal health aspects of placing these products on the market.</p>
<p class="text-left">This has resulted in a complex and confused situation, not least with regard to fisheries products and has led to the mixing of rules on hygiene, animal health and official controls and the existence of different hygiene regimes for products of animal origin and other food.</p>
<p class="text-left">The aim of the current Commission proposals is to simplify and clarify the legislation by separating food hygiene issues from those relating to official controls and animal health and thus eliminate the inconveniences that were inherent in the piecemeal approach of the 17 Directives.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   The Commission Proposals</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">There are five separate proposals contained in the Commission package: 4 draft Regulations which take up, modify and consolidate the content of the various Directives and one draft Directive which would then repeal the original 17 Directives.</p>
<p class="text-left">Proposals 1 and 2 deal with food hygiene. The first of these is a horizontal measure applicable to all food, while the second contains specific rules for food of animal origin. Proposal 3 deals with official controls on food of animal origin and proposal 4 deals with animal health issues, resulting from the consolidation of the hygiene rules and related to the production, placing on the market and importation of products of animal origin.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 1 - Hygiene of Foodstuffs</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This draft Regulation, which would replace Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs, contains the general hygiene rules applicable to all food and is based upon the following principles:</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Food business operators must continue to have the primary responsibility for food safety,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles prescribed by that Codex Alimentarius organisation should be introduced. It is proposed that this system should be mandatory for all food establishments and adopted as a management tool by food business operators to ensure food safety,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Food business operators must ensure traceability of food and food ingredients and must put in place products withdrawal procedures in case of food emergencies.</p>
<p class="text-left">–   It should be applied from "farm to table",</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Codes of good practice should be established by the various food sectors in order to give guidance to food business operators on food safety,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Imports from and imports to Third Countries must comply with Community hygiene standards,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Flexibility to cope with the special needs of small businesses and those operating in peripheral regions and remote areas such as mountains or islands. Special provision should be made for traditional food production and for the implementation of HACCP in particular in small businesses.</p>
<p class="text-left">The possibility for granting derogations on an ad hoc basis is provided for.</p>
<p class="text-left">A special Annex is devoted to primary production. It contains the elements that are considered essential to ensure food safety at that level, i.e.</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Codes for good farming (fishing) practice,</p>
<p class="text-left">–   Record keeping on food safety issues.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 2 - Specific Hygiene Rules for Food of Animal Origin</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This draft Regulation provides for specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (meat, milk, fish etc.) because of the different risks involved. These rules have been reduced from 14 different Directives into one much simplified text which offers more flexibility to food operators for defining the "in house" measures to be taken to ensure safe food.</p>
<p class="text-left">This proposal also contains provisions to ensure flexibility for small enterprises and traditional food.</p>
<p class="text-left">With regard to the fisheries sector, it covers the special hygiene conditions for the production, harvesting and transport of live bivalve molluscs, the rules for dispatch and purification centres and the health, labelling, packaging, storage and transport of the product.</p>
<p class="text-left">In respect of fishery products, the Regulation lays down the conditions for fisheries vessels including factory and freezer ships and stipulates the hygiene requirements applicable on board, and during and after landing. Health standards for fishery products are also set out. Finally, measures are proposed relating to the wrapping and packaging of fishery products, their storage and transport and the approval and registration of establishments.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 3 - Official Controls on Products of Animal Origin</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This proposal is a consolidation of the rules for official controls on products of animal origin, such as meat inspection and the control of harvesting areas for molluscs (Annex III). It represents mainly a consolidation of the multiplicity of control provisions scattered over the different Directives.</p>
<p class="text-left">No major innovations have been introduced, but in some cases there has been a shift of emphasis, e.g. the need to perform controls throughout the length of the food chain.</p>
<p class="text-left">In addition to the common control requirements, the official controls on fishery products should be carried out at the time of landing or before first sale at an auction or wholesale market. These should include organoleptic examination, chemical analysis and various other forms of surveillance testing.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission proposes that the following should be declared unfit for human consumption</p>
<p class="text-left">(a)   fishery products which the organoleptic, chemical, physical or microbiological checks show are not fit for human consumption;</p>
<p class="text-left">(b)   fish or parts of fish which have not been properly examined to detect endo-parasites in accordance with Community legislation;</p>
<p class="text-left">(c)   fishery products which contain in their edible parts contaminants present in the aquatic environment, such as heavy metals and organochlorinated substances, at levels where the calculated dietary intake would exceed the acceptable daily or weekly intake for humans;</p>
<p class="text-left">(d)   poisonous fish and fishery products containing biotoxins;</p>
<p class="text-left">(e)   fishery products or parts thereof considered dangerous to human health.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 4 - Animal Health Rules</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Although not directly linked to hygiene, this proposal results from the recasting of the hygiene rules and is aimed at preventing the spread of animal diseases resulting from the placing on the market of products of animal origin.</p>
<p class="text-left">The benefit of this proposal would be that all animal health rules would now be contained in a single instrument instead of being scattered over 7 Directives.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are various provisions relating to the health of aquaculture fish and live molluscs.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Proposal 5 - Repeal Directive</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This proposal would repeal all 17 Directives and has a standstill clause for existing implementing rules.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>3.</strong>   Comments and Conclusions</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Fisheries welcomes these proposals and supports their objectives of simplification, coherence and consolidation, while at the same time maintaining a high level of protection for the consumer.</p>
<p class="text-left">In particular, it supports the concept that food operators must bear full responsibility for the food they produce, so long as this is operated fair-handedly across the board and applied equally on the same basis to Third Country imports as to Community producers.</p>
<p class="text-left">For this reason, the Committee also welcomes the Commission decision to formulate its proposals in the form of Regulations as opposed to Directives, so as to ensure a uniform regime throughout the Community. However, despite this, the fisheries sector will put great store by the provisions on flexibility.</p>
<p class="text-left">Although traceability, "farm or sea to table" and the HACCP principles can all contribute to greater food safety and as such must be supported, the fisheries sector will be particularly concerned that adequate consideration is given to the special needs of the communities which it supports. Almost by definition, fishing is concentrated in remote or peripheral coastal regions, where few alternative sources of employment exist. In this context, any regulatory environment must be applied with great sensitivity.</p>
<p class="text-left">Codes to good practice, may in these circumstances, represent the most practical solution and the most appropriate tool for the small and medium sized businesses which dominate the sector in these regions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Article 1 of the hygiene of foodstuffs proposal and Annex I of Proposal 2 on specific hygiene rules, provide detailed definitions of primary and processed products and of live bivalve molluscs and fishery products. This represents a step forward for the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our Committee has consistently made the point, that while primary agricultural production has usually been taken to include fisheries products, fishing and aquaculture are covered by a quite separate Common Fisheries Policy, providing for specific provisions in Community food law to cover the sector.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, as recently as 1996, the Commission and Council, without consultation of the European Parliament, succeeded in foisting upon the fishing industry, charges to finance veterinary inspections under a directive originally designed to deal with <strong>meat</strong>. (Council of <strong>Agriculture </strong>Ministers decision of 24-27 June 1996, with regard to the Commission proposal to modify Directives (EEC)85/73()<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part9_ref1" href="#_part9_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 9.1">[1]</a>, (EEC)90/675()<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part9_ref2" href="#_part9_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 9.2">[2]</a> and (EEC)91/496)()<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part9_ref3" href="#_part9_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 9.3">[3]</a>. </p>
<p class="text-left">Legislation must be based on an assessment of the risks involved. In this particular instance however, this was patently obviously not the case, nor was any account taken of the specific nature of the "particular category of foodstuff" involved. Clear definitions and more transparent regulations should help to make such instances a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In conclusion, the Committee on Fisheries would point out that:</p>
<p class="text-left">a)   A regulatory regime must take account of the varying degrees of risk presented by different businesses according to their operating practices. General and uniform principles can and should be adopted centrally. However, these must be applied sensitively in peripheral and remote areas dependent on a particular segment of the food production industry, while at the same time the strict application of the rules must continue to be guaranteed in all cases.</p>
<p class="text-left">b)   The Fish Hygiene Directive (EEC) 91/493 <a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part9_ref4" href="#_part9_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 9.4">[4]</a> embraced the concept of self-monitoring and the responsibility of the industry to carry out its own controls. As the Commission states "the leitmotif throughout the recast of the hygiene rules is that food operators bear full responsibility for the safety of the food they produce. The implementation of hazard analysis and control principles and the observance of hygiene rules must ensure this safety." </p>
