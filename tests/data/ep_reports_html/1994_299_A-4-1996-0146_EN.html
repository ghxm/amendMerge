<p>1. <u>BACKGROUND</u></p>
<p>Since the sixties, the Community institutions have been concerned with giving effect to the freedom of establishment for professionals within the Community, an important principle established by Article 52 of the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p>The original approach was to take each regulated profession in turn and to harmonize the training needed to enter the profession (duration, content, etc.), thus creating mobility throughout the Community in the sector concerned.</p>
<p>No more than 20 directives were adopted in this way. They concerned essentially the medical and paramedical professions as well as architects. As far as the profession of lawyer is concerned, the Directive adopted in 1977 (77/249/EEC) merely liberalized the provision of services.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref1" href="#_part3_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.1">[1]</a></p>
<p>However, over the years, this approach proved itself to be long and laborious; it took 16 years to adopt the Directive on pharmacists and 17 years for the Directive on dentists. In the final analysis, this seemed to be a fundamentally limited approach.</p>
<p>Thus, in 1988, the Commission, using its right of initiative, decided to change its original philosophy fundamentally and replaced its sectoral approach with a global one; any young person who had completed in his own country training equivalent to school-leaving exam plus 3 enabling him to enter a regulated profession, could practise that profession in any other Community country. Later, at the request of the European Parliament, the Commission submitted an identical directive for levels lower than school-leaving exam plus 3, which was adopted on 18 June 1992 (Directive 92/51/EEC, OJ L 209, 24.7.1992, p. 25).</p>
<p>That general system, based on mutual recognition of higher education qualifications,<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref2" href="#_part3_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.2">[2]</a> was accompanied by certain compensatory safeguards for host Member States; but it represented a real revolution in so far as it was based on a simple principle which was fundamentally Community in spirit: mutual trust between the Member States.</p>
<p>The European Parliament gave an unqualified welcome to this novel approach (see the Fontaine report (A2-139/85) adopted on 14 November 1985<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref3" href="#_part3_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.3">[3]</a>). It shared the Commission's view that this system should in future be applied to all regulated professions not covered by a specific measure.</p>
<p>However, the European Parliament asked the Commission not to systematically rule out sectoral directives where:</p>
<p>- there is a demonstrable need or at least an improvement is made to the existing legal framework;</p>
<p>- there is a broad consensus within the profession concerned on the content of the planned provisions.</p>
<p>During the discussions which preceded the vote by the European Parliament (OJ 2370/114, 26.10.1988), Lord Cockfield explained this agreement very clearly on behalf of the Commission: 'We would not, however, exclude subsequent specific complementary directives once the general system is in operation, provided that the profession concerned supported the move and was already in agreement as to the content of the further directive, and that it could be shown that a specific directive would make movement between Member States more easy. I hope matters can now proceed on that basis'.</p>
<p>2. <u>THE INADEQUACIES OF THE PRESENT SITUATION</u></p>
<p>This is precisely the context of the proposal for a Directive of 21 December 1994 (COM(94)0572 final) which the Commission is today submitting to Parliament for consideration.</p>
<p>It thus complements the general Directive, and its objective is to improve the free movement of the professionals concerned, namely lawyers.</p>
<p>It meets an almost unanimous demand of the profession concerned; the lawyers of all the Member States of the Union - with the sole exception of Luxembourg - consider that a specific directive is needed. They take the view that the general system has not worked satisfactorily for their profession:</p>
<p>- firstly, the question of the right to practise on a permanent basis under the homecountry professional title has not been settled;</p>
<p>- secondly, experience has shown that the aptitude test that may be required by a Member State for professions requiring a precise knowledge of the national law of the host country has often constituted a real obstacle to the freedom of establishment for lawyers.</p>
<p>The general Directive entered into force on 4 January 1991, i.e. five years ago. The requirement that it be reviewed has not yet been placed on the agenda, since the maximum period of 5 years laid down in Article 13 has only just expired. Nevertheless, the specific concerns of Community lawyers should be looked into as soon as possible.</p>
<p>3. <u>THE COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL FOR A DIRECTIVE</u></p>
<p>What does the Commission's proposal envisage?  It sets out three main themes:</p>
<p>3.1 <u>The right for a lawyer to practise under his home-country professional title in any Member State other than his own</u></p>
<p>The only condition is that the lawyer should be registered with the competent authority of the host country.</p>
<p>The lawyer performs the same professional activities as a lawyer practising under the professional title of the host Member State. The one possible limitation concerns the activities of representing or defending a client before court of law where the host Member State may require that the assistance of a national lawyer be obtained; the national lawyer would, if necessary, be answerable to the court hearing the case.</p>
<p>Finally, a lawyer practising under his home-country professional title is subject to the rules governing professional practise and conduct of the host country in respect of all activities he pursues in the territory of that country.</p>
<p>However, the right to practise under the home-country professional qualification appears to be only temporary. The Commission limits it to five years. A lawyer who, at the end of that period, does not wish to be treated as a lawyer of the host country must therefore stop practising in the state in question.</p>
<p>3.2 <u>Access to the profession of the host Member State</u></p>
<p>After three years of 'effective and unbroken' activity in the law of the host Member State - including Community law - migrant lawyers are automatically treated as lawyers of the host Member State.</p>
<p>Thus migrant lawyers do not have to sit the aptitude test mentioned in the 1989 general Directive and they may practice permanently under the professional title of the host Member State while retaining the right, if they so wish, to also use their home-country professional title (<u>Article 10, paragraphs 1 to 6</u>).</p>
<p>However, where the unbroken period of three years' activity in the host Member State has not encompassed the law of that state, an aptitude test may be required. <u>Article 10(2) </u>stipulates that in such cases the test must be limited to the law of procedure and the rules of professional conduct of the host Member State.</p>
<p>3.3 <u>The possibility of joint practice</u></p>
<p>At the present time, not all Member States allow lawyers to practise jointly. And even in those Member States which do permit joint practice, it exists in different forms (partnerships, companies with share capital, adapted in specific ways).</p>
<p>The possibilities envisaged by the Commission are:</p>
<p>- lawyers who practise under their home-country professional title in a host Member State and who belong to the same grouping in their home Member State may pursue their professional activities in a branch or agency of their grouping (<u>Article 11(1)</u>);</p>
<p>- two or more lawyers from the same home Member State may be afforded access to a form of joint practice in the host country; they will then be governed by the rules of the host country (<u>Article 11(2)</u>);</p>
<p>- joint practice also between:</p>
<p>. lawyers from different Member States practising under their home-country professional titles;</p>
<p>. lawyers practising jointly with lawyers from the host Member State (<u>Article 11(3)</u>).</p>
<p>However, none of those possibilities may be extended to host Member States in which joint practice is still forbidden.</p>
<p>4. <u>CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE COMMISSION PROPOSAL</u></p>
<p>As the explanatory memorandum to the proposal for a Directive (COM(94)0572 final, p. 3) points out, the Commission has worked closely with the body which represents lawyers in European Union countries, i.e. the Consultative Committee of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Community (CCBE), which in October 1992 drew up a draft text on this matter (known as the Lisbon compromise). However, in the end the draft was not approved by all the bars concerned and the matter had to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>On 27 November 1995 in Dresden, the CCBE adopted a fresh compromise. Some of its proposed amendments secured the unanimous support of its members. The amendments concerning the two most contentious points (Articles 2 and 10) secured the backing of 14 of its 17 members. It should be remembered that the CCBE includes all the Union countries, plus Norway and Iceland.</p>
<p>Thus, it is up to the European Parliament to improve the proposal to make it acceptable to the whole profession and all clients groups and, moreover, to achieve further progress in the cultural integration of Europe. It is a challenge which the Committee on Legal Affairs and your rapporteur are keen to take up.</p>
<p>4.1 <u>Positive aspects of the proposal</u></p>
<p>4.1.1. The proposal for a Directive suitably complements the Community legislation now governing the freedom of establishment for lawyers within the Union, namely:</p>
<p>- Directive 77/249/EEC of 22 March 1977, which permits the free occasional provision of services under the home-country professional title;</p>
<p>- Directive 89/48/EEC of 21 December 1988 establishing a general system for the mutual recognition of higher education diplomas enabling Community citizens to gain access to the profession in the host country by means of certain conversion possibilities (an adaptation period or aptitude test, at the discretion of the host Member State).</p>
<p>4.1.2. The proposal constitutes an improvement in the legal framework in so far as it increases the opportunities for a Community lawyer to become established in another Member State under the professional title of that State, and it remedies certain failings of the 1988 Directive, cited above.</p>
<p>4.1.3 It satisfactorily resolves the problem of the law of procedure and rules of professional conduct. No Member State will have its rules modified. It is the rules of the host Member State which govern the activities of Community lawyers, but they also remain subject to the rules of their home Member State (see in this regard <u>Article 6(1)</u> which concerns the activities in the host Member State of lawyers practising under their homecountry professional titles).</p>
<p>4.1.4 Several years ago, the Commission planned a draft regulation permitting the liberal professions to be practised jointly across borders. So far the draft regulation has come to nothing because of a number of reservations. It is therefore appreciated that in this draft Directive the Commission has introduced provisions giving lawyers the possibility of practising jointly.</p>
<p>4.1.5 The draft Directive's approach is generally consistent with the case-law of the Court of Justice in the area of the freedom of establishment - respect for the principle of treatment as a national - but at the same time introduces a certain flexibility by making it possible to practise the profession under the home-country professional title.</p>
<p>4.2 <u>Points of criticism and proposed amendments</u></p>
<p>4.2.1. <u>Scope</u></p>
<p>The scope of the proposal for a directive as defined in Article 1 is satisfactory, with a single exception. There is a need to exclude a specific category of lawyer existing in certain Member States, namely lawyers assigned solely to the supreme courts as holders of a ministerial office conferred on them by their respective governments. The number of such appointments is restricted and is determined by the Member State concerned. Their situation is in many respects comparable to that of law officers in the strict sense and justifies the inclusion of <u>Amendment 9</u>.</p>
<p>4.2.2 <u>Membership of the host country bar</u></p>
<p>It is an entirely good thing that the proposal enables a lawyer who can demonstrate professional experience in the law of the host Member State to become wholly and permanently integrated as a lawyer of that state under more flexible conditions than those hitherto applicable under the system for the mutual recognition of diplomas. However, there are two points which raise questions:</p>
<p>4.2.2.1 The requirement for three years of 'effective and unbroken activity' means - according to <u>the second subparagraph of Article 10(1)</u> - the 'actual exercise of the activity without any interruption other than that resulting from the events of everyday life'. Although that definition is consistent with the case-law of the Court of Justice (see the judgment in Case 130/88 <em>Van de Bijl</em>), its relevance is questionable in the light of another judgment - well known to European lawyers - namely the judgment in Case 10⅞3 (<em>Ordre des Avocats au Barreau de Paris</em> v <em>Klopp</em>).<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref4" href="#_part3_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.4">[4]</a> In that judgment the Court of Justice held that 'the freedom of establishment includes freedom to set up and maintain, subject to observance of the professional rules of conduct, <u>more than one place of work within the Community</u>' (paragraph 19). Clearly, this would not be a real possibility if the wording of <u>the second subparagraph of Article 10(1)</u> of the proposal had to be adhered to. To deal with this problem a series of amendments have been tabled (5, 24 and 25), which are designed to take account of the principles established by the Klopp judgment by replacing the term '<u>unbroken</u>' by '<u>regular</u>'.</p>
<p>4.2.2.2 Community lawyers who cannot prove that they have exercised an activity involving the law of the host Member State could still be required to sit an aptitude test, albeit one limited to the law of procedure and the rules of professional conduct of that state. This could be regarded as contrary to the principle of mutual trust, on which the whole initiative is supposed to be based. It could also be a source of disparities and provide an opening for certain forms of protectionism. During the parliamentary debates held before the adoption of the general Directive, the European Parliament expressed at length its concerns about the aptitude test, even though that Directive applied primarily to young graduates and not - as is the case with the present Directive - lawyers with professional experience. Parliament wanted Community nationals in all professions - without exception - to be able to choose between a period of adaptation and an aptitude test. Lord Cockfield said, with regard to an amendment tabled by Mr Fernand Herman, that when the Directive had been in force for two years, he would ask the Commission 'to review the way the Member States have implemented it with respect to the legal professions and, if the system was not working in a satisfactory way, to make a new proposal with respect to these professions, effectively to abolish the aptitude test'. This is the motivation behind the amendments to Article 10, whilst providing a procedure for verifying the professional aptitude of the lawyer concerned (<u>Amendments 24 and 25</u>, and <u>Amendments 2 and 5</u> to the recitals). Once a lawyer has met the conditions for practising, his entitlement to join the bar of the host country without an aptitude test must be subject to the conditions laid down in Article 10 as amended.</p>
<p>4.2.3 <u>Practising under the home-country title</u></p>
<p>As has already been stressed, the fact that the proposal for a Directive lays down detailed rules for the exercise of the profession of lawyer under the home-country professional title constitutes progress. With regard solely to the area of activity (<u>Article 5</u>), it is agreed that the power to prepare formal documents is granted only to a specific category of professionals, i.e. 'solicitors' in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Everywhere else the principle applies that the formal nature of documents is a consequence of the delegation of the public power conferred on public officials, from which lawyers are excluded. However, one cannot help but reflect that, as the Commission itself pointed out in its explanatory memorandum: 'the increasing economic requirements and trade flows resulting from the single market mean that business people setting up in other Member States increasingly have need of advisers who can held them resolve the problems posed by their cross-border transactions and who cover, thanks to their specialized knowledge, a wide variety of laws'.</p>
<p>That is an accurate analysis; but in those circumstances, is it really necessary to force professionals who do not want to be integrated into the bar of the host Member State to go back and practise in their home country?  I have my doubts. It is true that the philosophy underlying the provisions of the Treaty of Rome dealing with establishment - which constitute the legal basis of the present Directive - would imply that the professionals concerned should be integrated by applying to them the principles of treatment as a national and non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, as hallowed by a long line of case-law of the Court of Justice.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref5" href="#_part3_def5" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.5">[5]</a> However, the economic context has changed considerably since 1957 and this should be taken into account.</p>
<p>This is a particularly sensitive point and even the <em>Klopp</em> judgment does not, in principle, appear to provide a clear answer. Mr Klopp had applied 'to take the oath as an <em>avocat</em> and to be registered for the period of practical training at the Bar in Paris, where he plans to establish chambers whilst remaining a member of the Düsseldorf Bar'.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref6" href="#_part3_def6" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.6">[6]</a> The case therefore concerned 'dual integration' and the Court of Justice did what it customarily does in such cases: it applied the principle of treatment as a national and the prohibition of discrimination, but did so in a flexible way to ensure that Mr Klopp received genuinely equal treatment with nationals.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref7" href="#_part3_def7" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.7">[7]</a> The question therefore arises whether the 'stretched' or 'flexible' principle of treatment as a national could not be extended to grant lawyers the right to practise in another Member State under the professional title of their home-country and to do so <u>permanently</u> and <u>by virtue of establishment</u> (rather the provision of services).</p>
<p>The judgment of 30 November 1995 given by the Court of Justice in the Gebhard case<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref8" href="#_part3_def8" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.8">[8]</a> did not answer this question directly, given that the case in question did not concern the situation of a lawyer demanding the freedom to practise under his home-country title. However, it did highlight three key ideas:</p>
<p>1. When a lawyer practises in a Member State other than his own 'on a stable and continuous basis', any questions which may arise in connection with this come under the principle of the freedom of establishment as instituted by Article 52 of the Treaty, rather than the simple provision of services, an area governed by other specific provisions which, according to the Court of Justice, are relatively open.</p>
<p>2. Where the profession of lawyer is pursued 'on a stable and continuous basis', the host country is entitled to lay down national rules governing this activity, such as membership of a bar and thus compliance with its requirements;</p>
<p>3. However, the host country's right to do so may not be discretionary nor <u>a fortiori </u>discriminatory vis-à-vis non-nationals of Community origin, otherwise, for example, the theoretical requirement of membership of a bar could not be imposed. In this regard, the Court sets four conditions, all of which must be met:</p>
<p>- first, the provisions must be non-discriminatory;</p>
<p>- second, they must be justified by imperative (the term is a strong one) requirements in the general interest;</p>
<p>- third, they must be suitable for securing the attainment of the objective which they pursue;</p>
<p>- finally, they must not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it; this is the principle of proportionality, familiar in Community law.</p>
<p><u>Amendments 1, 2, 3, 10 and 14</u> take account of the above developments and the arguments invoked in the Gebhard judgment by abolishing the restricted period of 5 years provided for in <u>Articles 2 and 4</u> of the proposal for a directive.</p>
<p>4.2.3.1  In line with the Gebhard judgment, the main factor with regard to the exercise of the right of establishment is the nature of the activities a Community national 'intends to pursue on the territory of the host Member State' (see point 32 and conclusion 4 of the judgment). According to the judgment, these activities do not necessarily have to be pursued within the restricted framework of membership of a professional body (points 29, 30 and 31). Consequently, there is no longer any reason to impose a time limit on the activity of a lawyer practising under his home-country title.</p>
<p>4.2.3.2 Finally, Amendments 15, 16 and 17 to <u>Article 4</u> should be taken together and are designed to give consumers greater security  and assuage the fears and concerns about the directive entertained by certain Member States, albeit a minority of CCBE members.</p>
<p>4.2.4  <u>Joint practice</u></p>
<p>With regard to group practice, the Commission proposes to allow Member States to impose restrictions on group practice where decision-making power within the group concerned is exercised preponderantly by persons who do not have the status of lawyer. Controls of this kind would seem to be difficult to implement in practice and an additional provision is needed to guarantee the independence of the profession effectively. That is the purpose of <u>Amendment 27</u>.</p>
<p>4.2.5 <u>Salaried lawyers</u></p>
<p>With the adoption of <u>Amendments 4, 22 and 23</u> the report changes the proposal's concept of salaried activity using the home-country professional title. As a direct consequence of the new wording of <u>Article 2</u>, under <u>Article 8</u> such activity is now authorized and cannot be prohibited by the host Member State (see particularly <u>Amendment 22</u>). The host Member State will only be entitled to prohibit a few specific activities, which are limited to those listed in the new paragraph inserted in Article 8 (see <u>Amendment 23</u>). This brings the directive's approach into line with that of Directive 77/249/EEC, concerning the freedom of lawyers to provide services (see <u>Article 6</u> of that directive and <u>Amendment 4</u>).</p>
<p>4.2.6 <u>Special aspects of the profession in the UK</u></p>
<p>The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has adopted a number of amendments to take account of special aspects of the UK legal profession. In the United Kingdom, there are three legal jurisdictions (England &amp; Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). In the case of those three legal jurisdictions, as well as in Ireland, there are two branches of the legal profession - solicitors and barristers (although in Scotland, barristers are called advocates) - and each branch has its own professional body/regulatory authority (meaning that there are six competent authorities in the UK as a whole and two competent authorities in Ireland). It is therefore important that when a migrant lawyer wishes to integrate into the UK or Irish legal profession a choice is made by that lawyer, first as to which jurisdiction he/she wishes to work in (in the case of the UK only) and secondly which branch of the legal profession - solicitor or barrister - he/she wishes to join.</p>
<p>This specific point is taken up in <u>Amendments 8, 11, 13, 18, 20, 24, 25</u> (in paragraph 5) and <u>26</u>.</p>
