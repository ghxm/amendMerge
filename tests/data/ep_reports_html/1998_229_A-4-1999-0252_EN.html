<p><strong>1. </strong><u><strong>Introduction</strong></u></p>
<p>The free movement of workers (Article 48) is one of the four freedoms initially laid down by the authors of the Treaty of Rome, and is a basic right. Regulation (EEC) 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on the free movement of workers and the Council Directive of 15 October 1968 on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers and Member States and their families are the backbone of law in this matter. These rights are being clarified and amplified by the case law of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p>The concept of the free movement of citizens (Article 8a) was introduced by the Single European Act and is broader than the concept of the free movement of workers. Three directives have been adopted since then, extending the freedom of movement to retired persons<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref1" href="#_part5_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.1">[1]</a>, to persons having sufficient resources<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref2" href="#_part5_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.2">[2]</a> and students<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref3" href="#_part5_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>The Commission recently appointed a high-level group on the free movement of persons, chaired by Mrs Simone Weil. Its conclusions were presented to the Commission on 18 March 1997 and formed the basis of the Commission's action plan for the free movement of workers<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref4" href="#_part5_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Parliament points out that the plan of action was adopted on 16 July 1998 (rapporteur Mrs Barbara Weiler)<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref5" href="#_part5_def5" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.5">[5]</a>. The Weiler report gave an in-depth analysis of the range of problems arising from this matter and in general favoured the Commission's approach.</p>
<p>The Weiler report covers a large range of matters concerning the free movement of workers, including questions relating to Regulation 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes. Your rapporteur decided not to consider these matters in this report as they will be better dealt with in the context of the separate Commission proposal on the coordination of social security systems.</p>
<p>After 1989 the Commission submitted a proposal to amend Regulation 1612/68 and Directive 68/360/EEC<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref6" href="#_part5_def6" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.6">[6]</a>, which broadly covered the aspects mentioned in the plan of action. On 14 February 1990 Parliament delivered its opinion on these proposals<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref7" href="#_part5_def7" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.7">[7]</a>. The amended Commission proposals were then blocked by the Council. They have now been withdrawn and replaced by this new proposal.</p>
<p>The current proposal directly follows the Commission's action plan for the free movement of workers. Your rapporteur therefore compared the proposal with Parliament's opinion as expressed in the Weiler report.</p>
<p>The Commission has opted to submit three separate proposals. The first two are presented together. The rapporteur will follow suit.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><u><strong>The first two proposals, to amend Regulation (EEC) 1612/68 on the free movement of workers within the Community and to amend Directive 68/360/EEC on the abolition of restrictions of movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States and their families</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Legal basis</strong></p>
<p>Article 49(EC) for both Regulation (EEC) 1612/68 and Directive 68/360/EEC.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Context</strong></p>
<p>The proposal is based on a number of different elements: the Veil Group's deliberations, the repeated calls for improvement of legal structures governing the free movement of workers by Parliament and political developments in the Union. The guidelines on employment adopted after the November 1997 European Council in Luxembourg stressed the importance of the vocational integration of workers and the unemployed in particular. To that end the unemployed had to be offered more training opportunities to improve their experience. The citizens' rights campaign showed that there was great public uncertainty in the Union over the chances for the successful exercise of the right of free movement which is unfortunately too often foiled by red tape and the inflexibility of the arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Regulation (EEC) 1612/68</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.3.1 Non-discrimination clause</strong></p>
<p>Under the new Article 1a, discrimination on grounds of racial origin, religion, age, sex or disability shall be prohibited under Regulation (EEC) 1612/68. This article also offers all those covered by Regulation (EEC) 1612/68 direct and improved protection against any unjustified discrimination, on the basis of fundamental individual rights.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.2 Geographical applicability</strong></p>
<p>The Court of Justice has repeatedly stated that the applicability of Community law with regard to the free movement of workers cannot be determined by the place at which the work is performed<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref8" href="#_part5_def8" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.8">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed Article 9a therefore states that workers who are posted within the Union or to countries outside the Union as well as workers who perform their work within the Union, can be covered so long as their employment relationships retain a sufficiently close link with a Member State.</p>
<p>This was not actually called for in the Weiler report, but its implications are fully consonant with its spirit.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.3 Persons covered</strong></p>
<p>After several judgments by the Court and urgings by Parliament, job-seekers and trainees are included in the new Article 1. Article 5 proposes including grants and subsidies for recruitment or training.</p>
<p>Article 10(1) would allow direct descendants and ascendants to instal themselves with a Community national who is employed in another Member State irrespective of whether they are dependants or not and irrespective of their age. Other members of the family who are dependants or who live under the worker's roof in the Member State whence he comes are also included.</p>
<p>Article 10(1) also provides that the partner assimilated to the spouse may follow the worker where the host Member State recognises the situation of unmarried couples for its own nationals.</p>
<p>Article 10(3) provides that the family members referred to in the previous paragraphs are entitled to equal treatment as regards all economic, fiscal, social, cultural and other benefits.</p>
<p>Article 11 provides for an inherent right of the spouse and children to engage in a paid economic activity, including self-employment.</p>
<p>Article 10(4) provides, in the event of dissolution of the marriage, for an independent right of residence for the family members after a residence period of three years, as suggested by the Weil high-level group.</p>
<p>Article 11 last indent stipulates that the family members shall keep the right to work in the event of dissolution of the marriage.</p>
<p>All these proposals echo the wishes of Parliament as expressed in the Weiler report, but one category of persons is not covered by the proposal. These are non-Community nationals legally residing within the Union. They, including the parents of migrant workers, still encounter real obstacles when moving within the Union; they may be required to obtain visas for even short stays in other Member States. This is also true of foreign workers legally residing in a Member State and posted to another Member State to provide a service.</p>
<p>The Veil Group had proposed the abolition of visas, but the Commission did not take up this recommendation, proposing to retain them while making it easier to obtain them.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.4 Material rights of the worker</strong></p>
<p>Workers already have the right to equal treatment in the host Member State, but as it is not always fully applied:</p>
<p>in Article 7(1) elements such as equal treatment as regards health and safety conditions are added, as are vocational retraining measures in the event of involuntary employment;</p>
<p>Article 7(2) is reworded to reflect more precisely the Court of Justice's decisions aimed at full integration of the worker at all levels: economic, cultural, recreational, social, etc;</p>
<p>in Article 7(3) the term 'vocational schools' is replaced by 'vocational training';</p>
<p>Article 7(4) covers cases where the worker interrupts his career in order to improve or perfect his training and his skills or to switch the direction of his career;</p>
<p>in Article 8(1) the concept of exercise of public-law function is replaced by new wording to reflect the Court of Justice's case law<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref9" href="#_part5_def9" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.9">[9]</a>;</p>
<p>All these amendments met requests by Parliament in the past.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.5 The principle of equivalence of situations</strong></p>
<p>For the migrant worker this field has been the most difficult and problematic.</p>
<p>The situation of doctors in Europe is a good example; when they move from one country to the other they cannot take their seniority with them and they are frequently asked to provide more guarantees than a non-Community national (for example in France as regards housemen). Another example is teaching staff from other Member States at Italian universities who are still discriminated against by the Italian authorities.</p>
<p>In a period of rapid technological development (in 10 years 80% of technologies will be new, so 80% of the working population will be working on the basis of education over 10 years old) it would seem highly valuable to take into account workers' individual experience.</p>
<p>The principle of equivalence of experience is all the more important as, if recruitment and career conditions are not coordinated, experts and graduates are likely to leave Europe.</p>
<p>A new paragraph 5 is inserted in Article 7 to incorporate the principle of equivalence of situations for professional purposes. There should be recognition of the same facts or personal or professional circumstances that have arisen in other Member States. This area has been a frequent source of problems and obstacles to migrant workers.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.6 Frontier workers</strong></p>
<p>Article 7a refers to the situation of frontier workers. It is general in nature and is designed to strengthen frontier workers' legal security. One of the main questions is to determine the benefits to which a frontier worker is entitled under the legislation of the country of employment, which is generally designed for workers who are resident. As a rule, it is considered that a frontier worker should enjoy the same benefits as a resident worker<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref10" href="#_part5_def10" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.10">[10]</a>. However, under certain circumstances it would be necessary to determine whether the situation of a resident and a non-resident worker are objectively comparable. This would be particularly the case for tax benefits. Determination of the objective comparability of situations is definitely a question of fact. The Commission recommendation of 21 December 1993 on the taxation of certain incomes received by non-residents in a Member State should form the basis for this interpretation.</p>
<p>However, your rapporteur considers that the question of residence of workers for tax purposes and in particular the problems of double taxation, should be considered in greater detail in the light of the proposals of the Veil Group and the Van Lancker report.</p>
<p>It has to be stressed that Article 7a is not likely to affect the field of application of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the coordination of social security schemes.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Directive 68/360/EEC</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.4.1 Job-seekers and trainees</strong></p>
<p>In Article 2(1) it is stated that freedom of movement also implies the right to leave the territory of the Member State in order to look for a job or undergo vocational training in another Member State (this is also true of trainees). A new subparagraph (d) is added to Article 8(1), stipulating that the Member States shall acknowledge a job-seeker's right of residence without the need for a residence permit. Article 6(4) states that a Community worker who already has a temporary residence permit is entitled to have it automatically renewed even if he is unemployed, provided he continues to look for work. A change to Article 7(2) is also proposed, to allow a worker resident for five years to stay in the host Member State even if he has lost the job for which the residence permit was issued. In Article 4(3)(b) it is stated that an attestation that a worker is undergoing vocational training is sufficient to obtain a residence permit.</p>
<p>All these proposals reflect demands made by Parliament in the past.</p>
<p><strong>2.4.2 Family members</strong></p>
<p>Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 as amended introduces important changes to the family status of the migrant worker, while granting individual direct rights to the members of his family. These changes must therefore be incorporated into Directive 68/360/EEC (including the ability of non-Community nationals legally resident in the Member States to obtain visas).</p>
<p><strong>2.4.3 Reinforcement of the right of residence and streamlining of administrative procedures</strong></p>
<p>Article 6(2) stipulates that a residence permit valid for at least five years is automatically renewable. An addition is made, laying down for both social and legal reasons that breaks in residence for medical reasons or for reasons of maternity, study or posting do not affect the right of residence.</p>
<p>The last indent of Article 6(3) provides for the granting of a five-year residence permit where the worker holds, for a period of 18 months, a number of jobs lasting for less than a year (in accordance with the Veil report).</p>
<p>Article 9(3) lays down that the Member States shall bring the administrative procedures for the granting of residence permits into line with the existing procedures for national identity documents.</p>
<p>A second paragraph is added to Article 10 to limit the application of expulsion procedures in cases where the person concerned is fully integrated in the host Member State and has special social, cultural and family ties with the Member State of residence.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><u><strong>Proposal to establish an advisory committee on freedom of movement and social security for Community workers and amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 1612/68 and (EEC) No 1408/71</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>3.1 Legal basis</strong></p>
<p>The decision is based on Articles 49, 51 and 235. As Community law stands, Articles 49 and 51 do not provide a legal basis for matters concerning non-Community nationals. As the proposed new advisory committee will have such powers, Article 235 is used as an additional legal basis.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Regulations 1612/68 and 1408/71 each established a tripartite advisory committee responsible for examining problems concerning the free movement of workers and coordination of social security schemes. These two institutions in their twenty years of existence have been valuable fora for dialogue and exchanges of experience between the Commission, the Member States and social partners.</p>
<p>With a view to improving their operation and rationalising financial and human resources the social partners have called for them to be merged.</p>
<p>The Commission takes up this request in its action plan for the free movement of workers and reiterates its intention in its communication of 20 May 1998 'adapting and promoting the social dialogue at Community level'<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref11" href="#_part5_def11" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.11">[11]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Structure and responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>The Commission is proposing to retain the tripartite structure but to change the number of members of the two committees. The governments will ensure that the degree of expertise is retained in the two fields concerned.</p>
<p>The term of office should be four rather than two years as at present.</p>
<p>Men and women should be proportionally represented.</p>
<p>The new committee will take on the responsibilities of the two present committees.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the new advisory committee is also to be responsible for questions concerning the situation of non-Community nationals in the European Union, in conformity with the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Comments and amendments</strong></p>
<p>Only 0.2% of the citizens of Europe live and/or work in a Member State other than their own. The work force is therefore far less mobile in the Union than in the United States (0.5%).</p>
<p>The rapporteur would stress the need for both workers and industry in the EU to create a genuine European labour market.</p>
<p>In this context the rapporteur welcomes this proposed decision, considering that the Commission's objectives are a step in the right direction, not only as regards rationalisation and simplification but also in view of the administrative and budgetary ramifications.</p>
<p>The rapporteur would nevertheless, without disputing the justification for the proposed structure, endorse the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Affairs and calls on the Commission:</p>
<p>- to reduce the number of participants to one per Member State (i.e. 15 in all),</p>
<p>- to take into consideration Parliament's vote at first reading on the 1999 draft budget (amendment 0498) the latter enters all appropriations earmarked for the committee procedure in the reserve (line A.800N) pending:</p>
<p>* a better distinction between substantive legislation and implementing provisions;</p>
<p>* a guarantee of effective oversight by the European Parliament of implementing rules;</p>
<p>* a simplification of the typology of ad hoc committees and procedures, in particular the abolition of regulatory committees;</p>
<p>* transparency of the executive procedure;</p>
<p>* the ruling out of any constraint on the Commission's power to commit expenditure as a result of decisions of a general or specific nature taken by the Council acting solely on its own responsibility.</p>
<p>The rapporteur would also like to concentrate on the central question of the equivalence of situations as this is fundamental not only for skilled workers who are not encouraged to embark on a European career, but also for young people with neither experience nor qualifications and whose experience and abilities are not exploited outside their country of origin.</p>
<p>Finally the rapporteur would broadly support an extension of the freedom of movement in the Community to non-workers (i.e. trainees, the unemployed, students and workers' families) as a vital element of European citizenship, to the extent that the legality of their status is acknowledged in national law.</p>

<p>Committee on Petitions</p>
<p>Letter from the committee chairman to Mr Stephen Hughes, chairman of the  Committee on Employment and Social Affairs</p>
<p>Luxembourg, 8 April 1999</p>
<p>Dear Mr Chairman,</p>
<p>At its meeting of 29 and 30 March 1999, the  Committee on Petitions examined the above question<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part6_ref1" href="#_part6_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 6.1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>During the meeting, it adopted the following conclusions:</p>
<p>With the passage of time the attention of Union citizens has become increasingly focused on social issues relating to freedom of movement and establishment.</p>
<p>The committee is called upon to consider numerous petitions concerning various problems encountered by individual citizens seeking to exercise their right to freedom of movement within the European Union. The European Parliament frequently receives complaints of cases in which the national authorities are making it harder for individual citizens to exercise their right to freedom of movement and establishment or even refusing to recognise these rights. Parliament therefore concludes that many of the obstacles to freedom of movement arise from failure to implement properly the relevant Community provisions and, not infrequently, from the disinclination of Member States to cooperate with Community authorities where necessary so as to bring national practices into line fully and rapidly with Community legislation. In particular, problems also arise from failure of the national authorities to cooperate with each other in facilitating the procedures applicable to migrant workers.</p>
<p>The Committee on Petitions agrees with the Commission that the effective implementation of rights such as freedom of movement depends upon effective rules to ensure the unimpeded exercise of these rights. For this reason, it welcomes the proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1612/68 and the proposal for a directive amending Council Directive 68/360/EEC in order to take account of experience gained over 30 years of implementing their provisions, together with the case law established by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, so as to fill any legal gaps and remedy any shortcomings encountered.</p>
<p>Petitions to Parliament reveal that frequently citizens encounter major difficulties and obstacles in seeking to exercise their rights because of the failure of the national authorities at central, regional or local level to comply fully with the latter or spirit of the relevant Community legislation. In many such cases the Commission on the request of the Committee on Petitions, initiates infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned in accordance with Article 169 of the EC Treaty. By its very nature, however, this procedure is a lengthy one resulting in the feeling of frustration among individual citizens hoping for a rapid solution to and who accordingly begin increasingly to question the effectiveness and significance of the European Union. The Committee on Petitions therefore considers that efforts should be directed towards prevention rather than cure concerning infringements of Community legislation and that this requires clear and generally accepted rules. It therefore notes with interest that the Commission proposal points to the need to make the rules more effective.</p>
<p>The Committee on Petitions hopes that, in this instance, the Council will not repeat its obstructionist tactics of previous years.</p>
<p>However, in addition to compliance with the letter of the law and the quality of the legislation itself, for it to be fully and properly implemented so as to uphold the fundamental right to freedom of movement, it is necessary to create the right outlook, accompanied by a willingness on the part of the individual citizen and, more importantly, the national authorities responsible for implementing this legislation to promote the European ideal.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that petitions provide a yardstick against which to assess the extent to which the relevant legislation has been implemented in practice, it is significant to note the large number of cases of Italian citizens who have for a long time been permanently resident in Germany who are deported following sentences for criminal offences, however minor, despite close family and other ties with the host country.</p>
<p>Other petitions in this area concern for example difficulties because of administrative obstacles to the recognition of degrees or vocational training qualifications obtained in a Member State other than the Member State of residence and those arising from excessively long delays in transposing into national law the relevant legislation concerning the recognition of academic and professional qualifications, as in the case of Greece.</p>
<p>In this context, the committee wishes to draw attention to the fact that the labourious and timeconsuming procedures for the recognition of degrees and other professional qualifications, which still exist in all the Member States, are not only a source of frustration but may even actually slow down the development of professional mobility within the European Union.</p>
<p>From examination of the petitions, it can be concluded that difficulties arise from failure to implement Community rules properly, cumbersome bureaucracy which even goes as far as to reject letters written in a language other than the language of the country of origin and an excessively inwardlooking approach based on national systems. This not only affects those immediately concerned but, more generally serves to undermine the ideal of a community in which guarantees freedom of movement for individuals able to enjoy their rights.</p>
<p>The petitions reveal, on the one hand, the position adopted in certain cases by the national authorities concerning rights deriving from Community law, and on the other hand, the ideas and expectations of individual citizens of the European Union concerning the exercise of their fundamental rights. Whether or not such expectations are justified, it is extremely important to inform the members of the public about their rights and obligations and of the opportunities offered by freedom of movement within the Community.</p>
<p><u>CONCLUSIONS</u></p>
<p>- The Committee on Petitions welcomes the initiative by the Commission to remove those obstacles, whose effect is to undermine the fundamental right to freedom of movement embodied in the Treaty.</p>
<p>- It also welcomes the fact that the amendments tabled by the Commission take due account of the measures repeatedly urged by Parliament and in particular the Committee on Petitions. In considering the petitions, the committee had already noted the need for such amendments so as to incorporate the new elements arising from the implementation of Community legislation in this field and to take account of the economic and social divergencies accompanying the development of the Community.</p>
<p>- The Committee on Petitions therefore considers that clear information for the individual citizen and for the national authorities responsible for implementing the rules concerning the right to freedom of movement is a fundamental precondition for full exercise of this right.</p>
<p>It therefore believes that the value of measures to provide greater understanding and information for the public concerning this matter cannot be underestimated. It considers that the Commission should take coordinated action to ensure that the national authorities are made aware of the need for greater assimilation of Community rules and, more generally, the European ideal at national level.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>(Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure)</p>
<p>for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs</p>
<p>on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing an Advisory Committee on freedom of movement and social security for Community workers and amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 1612/68 and (EEC) No 1408/71 (COM(98)0394 - C4-0577/98 - 98/0231(COD)) (report by Mrs Hermange)</p>
<p>Committee on Budgets</p>
<p>Letter from the committee chairman to Mr Stephen Hughes, chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs</p>
<p>Brussels, 8 December 1998</p>
<p>Dear Mr Hughes,</p>
<p>At its meeting of 7 and 8 December 1998 the Committee on Budgets considered the above three proposals.</p>
<p>It noted that the first two proposals seek to strengthen the legal framework regarding freedom of movement. The report by the high level group published in March 1997 stresses the fact that political and sociological changes in the European Union should be reflected in its legislation. This should be done, in particular, by incorporating the guidelines on employment adopted following the European Council meeting in Luxembourg and the expectations arising from the establishment of the status of European citizenship.</p>
<p>It considered that these legal changes had no budgetary implications.</p>
<p>The Committee on Budgets focused its attention on the third proposal seeking to merge two advisory committees (on freedom of movement for workers and on social security for workers) and recalled, in this connection, its recent opinion on a similar procedure relating to the establishment of a single standing committee on employment<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref1" href="#_part7_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, it welcomed this initiative aimed at rationalising objectives and simplifying administrative procedures.</p>
<p>However, it expressed reservations about the commitology expenditure, i.e. ECU 64 680 to be entered against budgetary line A-7031 '<em>Expenditure on meetings of committees whose consultation is compulsory in the procedure for drafting Community legislation'</em>. It therefore called on the Commission:</p>
<p>- to limit the number of participants to one per Member State (45 in all) broken down as indicated in the following amendment, considering that the merger of the two committees should lead to economies in terms of the number of participants, who would now have combined responsibilities. It also recalled that Article 150 of the Treaty stipulates that, <em>where a vote is taken, any member of the Council may also act on behalf of not more than one other Member State</em>;</p>
<p>- to take due account of the European Parliament's position at first reading on the draft budget for 1999 (Amendment 0498), which enters all the commitology appropriations in a reserve (line A-800N) pending:</p>
<p>. a better distinction between substantive legislation and implementing provisions;</p>
<p>. a guarantee of effective oversight by the European Parliament of implementing rules;</p>
<p>. simplification of the typology of ad hoc committees and procedures, in particular the abolition of regulatory committees;</p>
<p>. transparency of the executive procedure;</p>
<p>. ruling out of any constraint on the Commission's power to commit expenditure as a result of decisions of a general or specific nature taken by the Council acting solely on its own responsibility.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Detlev Samland</p>
