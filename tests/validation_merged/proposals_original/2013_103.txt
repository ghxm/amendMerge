Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community and Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community /* COM/2013/0192 final - 2013/0103 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

Grounds for and objectives of theproposal

This proposal concerns amendments toRegulation (EC) No 1225/2009 (“the basic anti-dumping regulation”) andRegulation (EC) No 597/2009 (“the basic anti-subsidy regulation”). Takingaccount of the fact that these Regulations have not been substantially revisedsince the completion of the Uruguay Round in 1995 and taking account of theconclusions of the evaluation study carried out into the functioning of these instruments,it is proposed to update and modernise the instruments.

General context

Article 207 of the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union provides, inter alia, for measures to be established to protect trade suchas those to be taken in the event of dumping or subsidies.

Existing provisions in the area of theproposal

The above-mentioned Council Regulations.

Consistency with the other policies andobjectives of the Union

There is no conflict with any policy orobjective of the Union.

2.           RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONSWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

Consultation of interested parties

Interested parties concerned by thisproposal have had the opportunity to participate in the Public consultationcarried out from April to July 2012. A summary of the results of the publicconsultation has been available on DG Trade’s website since October 2012.

Collection and use of expertise

An evaluation study into the functioning ofthe EU’s anti-dumping and anti-subsidy instruiments was finalised in early-2012and has been available on DG Trade’s website since then.

Impact Assessment

Taking into account the results of thepublic consultation, the evalutation study and the Commission's extensivepractice in the use of the instruments an impact assessment was carried out inautumn 2012. The impact assessment report identified problems in thefunctioning of the trade defence instruments and proposed various solutions.The Impact Assessment Board considered the report in December 2012 and gave afavourable opinion subject to some revisions to the report. The report hassince been revised and finalised. The preferred solutions form the basis forthis proposal.

3.           LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THEPROPOSAL

Summary of the proposed action

It is proposed to amend the basicanti-dumping and basic anti-subsidy Regulations in order to improve them in anumber of areas. Regarding transparency and predictability, these will beenhanced by providing that interested parties are informed two weeks in advanceof the imposition of provisional measures that such measures are going to beimposed. Parties will also be given a guarantee that the measures will not beimposed within this two week period. A summary of the basis on which it isintended to impose the measures will be sent to interested parties and theywill have the opportunity to comment on the calculation of the dumping andinjury margins. Furthermore, when it is decided not to impose provisionalmeasures but to continue the investigation, interested parties will be informedof the intention not to impose such measures two weeks in advance of theultimate date for imposition.

Concerning threats of retaliation againstUnion producers who are considering lodging an anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidycomplaint, such threats can be considered to constitute special circumstancesthat warrant the ex-officio opening of an investigation. Furthermore, wheninvestigations are opened on an ex-officio basis, it is proposed to obligeUnion producers to cooperate in the proceeding.

In regard to the effectiveness of theinstruments, it is proposed to remove the lesser duty rule in cases of circumvention,or where structural raw material distortions have been found to exist, andsubsidisation. Concerning reviews, it is proposed to reimburse duties collectedduring an expiry review investigation that is concluded by the repeal of themeasures.

Finally, there are a number of areas whereit is proposed to codify certain practices which stem from ECJ or WTO rulingsthat have been handed down in recent years. These concern the definition ofUnion industry, the consequences for exporting producers found not to bedumping or to be dumping at de-minimis levels in an originalinvestigation, dealing with changed circumstances in a review investigation,the treatment of related companies in anti-circumvention investigations, theconditions for the registration of imports and the basis for choosing a sampleof Union producers.

Legal basis

Article 207 of the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union.

Subsidiarity principle

The proposal falls under the exclusivecompetence of the Union. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply.

Proportionality principle

The proposal complies with theproportionality principle for the following reasons:

The form of action is described in theaforementioned basic Regulations and leaves no scope for national decisions.

It will not entail any increased financialor administrative burden on the Union, national governments, regional and localauthorities, economic operators and citizens. However, the reimbursement ofduties collected during an ongoing expiry review, if such an expiry review doesnot lead to a prolongation of measures, is handled by national customsauthorities. The additional workload on customs authorities is considered to besmall and proportionate to the objective of the proposal, i.e. increasingfairness of the instruments.

The non-application of the lesser duty rulein cases of circumvention, or where structural raw material distortions havebeen found to exist, and subsidisation is proportionate to the additional needto protect trade in these situations.

Choice of instruments

Proposed instruments: Regulation.

Other means would not be adequate for thefollowing reason(s):

The aforementioned basic Regulations do notprovide for alternative options.

4.           BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

The proposal has implications for the Unionbudget. The non-application of the lesser duty rule under certain circumstanceswill in some cases lead to higher duty levels and is thus revenue enhancing. Thereimbursement of duties in cases where measures are terminated after an expiryreview represents an expense for the Union budget. Quantification is verydifficult since any revenue or expense depends on the circumstances of eachindividual case.

The proposed legislative changes will alsoentail some changes to the practice. These will not have any budgetaryimplications but changes to the working routines (e.g.: pre-disclosure, advancenotice, summary document). The upgrading of the SME helpdesk (explained in thecommunication) has resource implications set out in the attached legislativefinancial statement.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Council Regulation (EC) No1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members ofthe European Community and Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protectionagainst subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the EuropeanUnion, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the nationalparliaments,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)       The common rules forprotection against dumped and subsidised imports from countries which are notmembers of the European Union are contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countriesnot members of the European Community[1]and Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protectionagainst subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community[2] respectively (hereinafterjointly referred to as the 'Regulations'). The Regulations were initiallyadopted in 1995 following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Given that anumber of amendments were made to the Regulations since then, the Councildecided in 2009 to codify the regulations in the interest of clarity andrationality.

(2)       While the Regulations havebeen amended, there has not been a fundamental review of the functioning ofthese instruments since 1995. As a result, the Commission launched a review ofthe Regulations in 2011 in order to, inter alia, better reflect theneeds of business at the beginning of the 21st century.

(3)       Following the review,certain provisions of the Regulations should be amended in order to improvetransparency and predictability, provide for effective measures to fightagainst retaliation, improve effectiveness and enforcement and optimise reviewpractice. In addition, certain practices that in recent years have been appliedin the context of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations should beincluded in the Regulations.

(4)       In order to improvetransparency and predictability of anti-dumping and anti-subsidyinvestigations, the parties affected by the imposition of provisionalanti-dumping and countervailing measures, in particular importers, should bemade aware of the impending imposition of such measures. The time given shouldcorrespond to the period between the submission of the draft implementing actto the anti-dumping committee established pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation(EC) No 1225/2009 and the anti-subsidy committee established pursuant toArticle 25 of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 and the adoption of that act by theCommission. This period is fixed in Article 3(3) of Regulation (EU) No182/2011. Also, in investigations where it is not appropriate to imposeprovisional measures, it is desirable that parties are aware sufficiently inadvance of such non-imposition.

(5)       A short period of time inadvance of the imposition of provisional measures should be allowed forexporters or producers to check the calculation of their individual dumping orsubsidy margin. Calculation errors could then be corrected in advance of theimposition of measures.

(6)       In order to ensureeffective measures to fight against retaliation, Union producers should be ableto rely on the Regulations without fear of retaliation by third parties. Existingprovisions, under special circumstances, provide for the initiation of aninvestigation without having received a complaint, where sufficient evidence ofthe existence of dumping, countervailable subsidies, injury and causal linkexists. Such special circumstances should include threat of retaliation.

(7)       When an investigation is notinitiated by a complaint, an obligation should be imposed on Union producers toprovide the necessary information in order for the investigation to proceed, inorder to ensure that sufficient information is available for carrying out theinvestigation in case of such threats of retaliation.

(8)       Third countriesincreasingly interfere in trade of raw materials with a view to keeping rawmaterials in those countries for the benefit of domestic downstream users, forinstance by imposing export taxes or operating dual pricing schemes. As aresult, the costs of raw materials do not result from the operation of normalmarket forces reflecting supply and demand for a given raw material. Suchinterference creates additional distortions of trade. As a consequence, Unionproducers are not only harmed by dumping, but suffer, compared to downstreamproducers from third countries engaged in such practices, additionaldistortions of trade. In order to protect trade adequately, the lesser duty ruleshall not apply in such cases of structural raw material distortions.

(9)       Within the Union, countervailable subsidies are in principle prohibited pursuant to Article 107 (1)TFEU. Therefore, countervailable subsidies granted by third countries are particularlydistortive of trade. The amount of State aid authorized by the Commission hassteadily been reduced over time. For the anti-subsidy instrument, the lesserduty rule should hence no longer be applied to imports from a country/countriesengaged in subsidisation.

(10)     In order to optimise the reviewpractice, duties collected during the investigation should be reimbursed toimporters, where measures are not prolonged after the conclusion of an expiryreview investigation. This is appropriate given that the conditions requiredfor the continuation of the measures have not been found to exist during theinvestigation period.

(11)     Certain practices which inrecent years have been applied in the context of anti-dumping and anti-subsidyinvestigations should be included into the Regulations.

(12)     The Union industry shouldno longer be defined by reference to the initiation thresholds set out in theRegulations.

(13)     In initial investigationswhere dumping or subsidy margins have been found to be less than the deminimis thresholds, the investigation should be immediately terminated inrelation to exporters that will not be subject to subsequent reviewinvestigations.

(14)     In the framework ofanti-dumping and anti-subsidy review investigations, it seems appropriate to beable to change methodology as compared to the investigation that led to the imposition of the measure in order to ensurethat, inter alia, coherent methodologies are used across differentinvestigations at a given point in time. This will allow, in particular, scopeto change methodologies which are revised over time as situations change.

(15)     When the conditions are metfor initiating an anti-circumvention investigation, imports should in all casesbe made subject to registration.

(16)     In anti-circumventioninvestigations, it seems advisable to remove the condition that, in order to begranted an exemption from registration or extended duties, producers of theproduct concerned should not be related to any producer subject to the originalmeasures. This is because experience shows that sometimes producers of theproduct concerned are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices butare found to be related to a producer subject to the original measures. In suchcases the producer should not be denied an exemption merely on the grounds thatthe company is related to a producer subject to the original measures. Also,when the circumvention practice takes place in the Union, the fact thatimporters are related to producers subject to the measures should not bedecisive in determining whether the importer may be granted an exemption.

(17)     Where the number ofproducers in the Union is so large that resort must be made to sampling, asample of producers should be chosen from among all producers in the Union and not just from among producers lodging the complaint.

(18)     In making the Unioninterest assessment, the opportunity to provide comments should be given to allproducers in the Union and not just those producers lodging the complaint.

(19)     Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009and Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,
