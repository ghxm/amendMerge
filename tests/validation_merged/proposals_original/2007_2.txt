Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

on energy statistics

(presented by the Commission)

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1) CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

1.1. Grounds for and objectives of the proposal

The development of Community policy and legislation on energy highlights the need for comprehensive and comparable European statistics on a range of energy related issues. Directives with clear quantitative targets and deadlines on energy in the EU implicitly require the need of monitoring the energy situation in order to verify if and how well such goals are met.

The huge influence of energy transformation and consumption on our environment is bound to remain an issue of concern in the long-term future which emphasizes the requirement of accurate energy data. A correct and precise energy accountancy has become particularly relevant following the entry-into-force of the Kyoto Protocol on 16 February 2005 : our energy use is responsible for 80 % of the total EU emissions of greenhouse gases.

The proposal also takes into full consideration the cooperation of the Commission with the International Energy Agency (IEA) on energy statistics: the proposed data collection covers entirely the part that is shared with the IEA in the context of this cooperation.

1.2. General context

At the Hampton Court Summit the Heads of State called for a European Energy Policy. In response to that the Commission prepares a package of measures as they are highlighted in the recent green paper on energy.

The availability of timely and reliable data on the energy situation in the EU is of paramount importance for succeeding in this objective. This importance justifies a stable, institutional basis for the collection of energy data which is at present still undertaken by voluntary agreements.

The subject proposal also takes attention to minimize the burden on enterprises : although this regulation does not reduce the existing burden, it does not add new obligations nor increase the existing scope of energy data collection in the EU. The objective of the proposed Regulation is therefore not to modify the statistical work that is already being done, but to provide a legal framework for it.

This legal framework is proposed at a time when Member States experience more and more difficulties in the subject data collection. The liberalisation of the energy market resulted i.a. in the appearance of large numbers of energy producers and resellers which made the data collection far more complex. This put the resources allocated to energy data collection under pressure, particularly since energy has remained one of the few unregulated statistical domains.

The fact that this market liberalisation also causes issues with commercial confidentiality makes it more difficult for Member States officials to perform their statistical work on the basis of a gentlemen's agreement.

In recent years, a general decline of the statistical quality (completeness, accuracy, timeliness) is being noticed. It is considered appropriate that initiatives be taken to underline the essential needs of reliable energy data i.a. by providing a regulated confirmation of the requirement for such important data collection work.

The significant recent increases of the energy prices have increased the awareness of the European citizens and policy makers on the complexity of our energy situation. Insight in this energy situation requires availability of accurate, timely and complete statistical data on energy.

1.3. Existing provisions in the area of the proposal

Commission Recommendation 88/96/ECSC concerning coal statistics, expired together with the ECSC on 23 July 2002. Council Regulation (EC) No 2964/95 of 20 December 1995, introducing registration for crude oil imports and deliveries in the Community. The proposed Regulation includes these data in an aggregated manner and confidentiality problems which prevent timely dissemination are solved by the data collection to which this Regulation proposal refers. It has to be noted that, even if the present proposal does not cover energy prices, several legal provisions exist on energy prices. They are listed here for easy reference: Commission Decision 1999/566/EC of 26 July 1999 implementing Council Decision 1999/280/EC regarding a Community procedure for information and consultation on crude oil supply costs and the consumer prices of petroleum products. The proposed Regulation does not include the data referred to in this Decision. Council Directive 90/377/EEC of 29 June 1990 concerning a Community procedure to improve the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged to industrial end-users. |

-  1.4. Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union

Detailed reference to the extensive EU energy policies is made in the justification part of this proposal. The Kyoto protocol imposes high quality requirements on the inventory data of greenhouse gasses, for which energy consumption is extensively responsible. The EU policies on intelligent energy and on renewable energy require detailed quantitative monitoring to measure progress towards targets. Also the Community strategy for sustainable development includes important ambitions notably on the development of biofuels and other renewable fuels, the data of which are covered by this Regulation as well. |

2) CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT

2.1 Consultation of interested parties

Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents The subject proposal has been discussed in a work group meeting on 13-14 June 2005 in Luxembourg, by subsequent correspondence with the existing data providers of the Member States and during the meeting of 18-19 May 2006 of the Statistical Programme Committee. |

Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account A very positive and supportive response has been noted. |

2.2. Collection and use of expertise

There was no need for external expertise.

2.3. Impact assessment

The implementation of the proposed Regulation will have a limited impact on the Member States, because the described data collection is already carried out in its entirety on a voluntary basis.

This proposal is quite meaningful for environmental considerations because of the huge influence of the use of energy on the environment. Accurate and timely data on the energy situation in the EU will permit to draw a clear and quantitative picture of this impact and of the current trends.

The economic influence is limited. However, this proposal may contribute to supply a clearer picture on energy imports and exports as well as on production and consumption by type of fuel.

3) LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL

3.1. Summary of the proposed action

The objective of this proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council is to establish a common framework for the collection and compilation of Community statistics on energy production, imports and exports, transformation and consumption. This framework makes extensive use of the existing data collection and also of the cooperation at international level with other relevant organisations, so that a methodological uniformity and data comparability are guaranteed. The objective is therefore not to open a new statistical domain, but rather to provide a helpful legal basis for an existing, quite important effort of making reliable data available in a timely manner for Community policy on energy.

3.2. Legal basis

Article 285 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides the legal basis for Community statistics. The Council, acting in accordance with the codecision procedure, shall adopt measures for the production of statistics where necessary for the performance of the activities of the Community. This Article sets out requirements relating to the production of Community statistics and requires conformity to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.

3.3. Subsidiarity principle

Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely establishing a common framework for the production, transmission, evaluation and dissemination of comparable energy statistics in the Community cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level on the basis of a Community legal act because only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at Community level, while the collection of data and compilation of comparable statistics on energy can be organised by the Member Sates, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiary as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.

3.4. Proportionality principle

The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). |

In accordance with the principle of proportionality this Regulation confines itself to the minimum required to achieve this objective and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose. This Regulation does not legislate the data collection mechanisms for each Member State; it merely defines the energy data to be supplied in a harmonised structure and timing. |

There is no obligation for the Member States to make any changes in their administrative systems related to the production of energy statistics. No new items are proposed for data collection in this Regulation beyond what is already being undertaken on a voluntary basis at EU level. It is appreciated that the legislation may, for some Member States, imply some developments or additions to their existing energy statistics systems. Eurostat will continue to work closely with the competent national authorities and will seek to minimise any potential difficulties caused by the implementation of this Regulation. |

3.5. Choice of instruments

Proposed instruments: regulation. |

Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). In taking into account the particular characteristics of each type of legislative act as described in Article 249 of the EC Treaty, it may be suggested that Regulations are the most appropriate tool for the production of Community Statistics. In fact, almost all the requirements of statistics need direct and immediate execution in Member States. They generally concern specifically identified statistical units in the Member States, the objective being clear and immediately applicable and all the elements to be surveyed being specified in the act together with methodology, timing and periodicity. As such they are not in general dependant on national measures for harmonisation. National authorities, being concerned by the measures, simply have to apply them. |

4) BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. |

5) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

5.1. European Economic Area

The proposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area.

2007/0002 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

on energy statistics

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1],

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[2],

Whereas:

(1) The Community needs to have precise and timely data on energy quantities, their forms, sources, generation, supply, transformation and consumption, for the purpose of monitoring the impact and consequences of its policy work on energy.

(2) Availability of accurate and up-to-date information on energy is essential for assessing the impact of energy consumption on the environment, in particular in relation to the emission of greenhouse gasses; this information is required by the Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 concerning a mechanism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions and for implementing the Kyoto Protocol[3].

(3) Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market[4] and Directive 2004/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market and amending Directive 92/42/EEC[5] require Member States to report quantitative energy data. To follow the evolution towards these objectives, detailed and uptodate energy data are required.

(4) The Green Papers COM(2005) 265 of the Commission of 22 June 2005 on Energy Efficiency or Doing More With Less and COM(2006) 105 of 8 March 2006 on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy lay down EU energy policies for which the availability of EU energy statistics are required (among others, for the purpose of establishing a European Supply Observatory).

(5) The liberalisation of the energy market makes it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable and timely energy data in the absence of a legal basis concerning the provision of such data.

(6) It is essential that a system of statistics relating to energy can adapt flexibly to a situation that is expected to evolve in the future.

(7) The production of Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics[6].

(8) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely establishing a common framework for the production, transmission, evaluation and dissemination of comparable energy statistics in the Community cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.

(9) In the production and dissemination of Community statistics under this Regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities will take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee on 24 February 2005 and attached to the Recommendation of the Commission on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities[7].

(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[8].

(11) In particular, the measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of the regulation should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. Other measures of general scope applying essential elements of the regulation should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure.

(12) It is necessary to foresee that the Commission may grant exemptions or derogations to Member States from those parts of the energy data collection that would lead to excessive burden on respondents.

(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee (SPC), established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC of 19 June 1989[9].

It is characterized by higher volatile matter than anthracite (more than 10%) and lower carbon content (less than 90% fixed carbon). Its gross calorific value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis. If bituminous coal is used in coke ovens it should be reported as coking coal. |

4 | Sub-Bituminous Coal | Refers to non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value between 17 435 kJ/kg (4 165 kcal/kg) and 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) containing more than 31% volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis. |

5 | Lignite/Brown Coal | Non-agglomerating coal with a gross calorific value less than 17 435 kJ/kg (4 165 kcal/kg) and greater than 31% volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis. Oil shale and tar sands produced and combusted directly should be reported in this category. Oil shale and tar sands used as inputs for other transformation processes should also be reported in this category. This includes the portion of the oil shale or tar sands consumed in the transformation process. Shale oil and other products derived from liquefaction should be reported on the Annual Oil Questionnaire. |

6 | Peat | A combustible soft, porous or compressed, fossil sedimentary deposit of plant origin with high water content (up to 90% in the raw state), easily cut, of light to dark brown colour. Peat used for non-energy purposes is not included. |

8 | Coke Oven Coke | The solid product obtained from carbonization of coal, principally coking coal, at high temperature, it is low in moisture and volatile matter. Coke oven coke is used mainly in the iron and steel industry acting as energy source and chemical agent. Coke breeze and foundry coke are included in this category. Semi-coke (a solid product obtained from carbonization of coal at low temperature) should be included in this category. Semi-coke is used as a domestic fuel or by the transformation plant itself. This heading also includes coke, coke breeze and semi-coke made from lignite/brown coal. |

9 | Gas Coke | By-product of hard coal used for production of town gas in gas works. Gas Coke is used for heating purposes. |

10 | Coal Tar | A result of the destructive distillation of bituminous coal. Coal tar is the liquid by-product of the distillation of coal to make coke in the coke oven process or it is produced from brown coal ("low-temperature tar"). Coal tar can be further distilled into different organic products (e.g. benzene, toluene, naphthalene), which normally would be reported as a feedstock to the petrochemical industry. |

11 | BKB (Brown Coal Briquettes) | BKB is a composition fuel manufactured from lignite/brown coal, produced by briquetting under high pressure without the addition of a binding agent. These figures include peat briquettes, dried lignite fines and dust. |

12 | Gas Works Gas | Covers all types of gases produced in public utility or private plants, whose main purpose is manufacture, transport and distribution of gas. It includes gas produced by carbonization (including gas produced by coke ovens and transferred to gas works gas), by total gasification with or without enrichment with oil products (LPG, residual fuel oil, etc.), and by reforming and simple mixing of gases and/or air, reported under the rows "From Other Sources". Under the transformation sector identify amounts of gas work gas transferred to blended natural gas which will be distributed and consumed through the natural gas grid. The production of other coal gases (i.e. coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and oxygen steel furnace gas) should be reported in the columns concerning such gases, and not as production of gas works gas. The coal gases transferred to gas works plants should then be reported (in their own column) in the transformation sector in the gas works plants row. The total amount of gas works gas resulting from transfers of other coal gases should appear in the production line for gas works gas. |

13 | Coke Oven Gas | Obtained as a by-product of the manufacture of coke oven coke for the production of iron and steel. |

14 | Blast Furnace Gas | Produced during the combustion of coke in blast furnaces in the iron and steel industry. It is recovered and used as a fuel partly within the plant and partly in other steel industry processes or in power stations equipped to burn it. The quantity of fuel should be reported on a gross calorific value basis. |

15 | Oxygen Steel Furnace Gas | By-product of the production of steel in an oxygen furnace, recovered on leaving the furnace. The gas is also known as converter gas, LD gas or BOS gas. |

16 | Hard coal | The term “hard coal” refers to coal of gross calorific value greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ashfree but moist basis and with a mean random reflectance of vitrinite of at least 0.6. Hard coal comprises all energy products from 1 to 3 together (anthracite, coking Coal and other Bituminous Coal). |

4.1. APPLICABLE ENERGY PRODUCTS

Unless otherwise specified this data collection applies to all of the following energy products :

Energy Product | Definition |

1 | Crude Oil | Crude oil is a mineral oil of natural origin comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons and associated impurities, such as sulphur. It exists in the liquid phase under normal surface temperature and pressure and its physical characteristics (density, viscosity, etc.) are highly variable. This category includes field or lease condensate recovered from associated and non-associated gas where it is commingled with the commercial crude oil stream. |

2 | NGL | NGL are liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered from natural gas in separation facilities or gas processing plants. Natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane (normal and iso-), (iso) pentane and pentanes plus (sometimes referred to as natural gasoline or plant condensate). |

3 | Refinery Feedstocks | A refinery feedstock is a processed oil destined for further processing (e.g. straight run fuel oil or vacuum gas oil) excluding blending. With further processing, it will be transformed into one or more components and/or finished products. This definition also covers returns from the petrochemical industry to the refining industry (e.g. pyrolysis gasoline, C4 fractions, gasoil and fuel oil fractions). |

4 | Additives/ Oxygenates | Additives are non-hydrocarbon compounds added to or blended with a product to modify fuel properties (octane, cetane, cold properties, etc.): • oxygenates, such as alcohols (methanol, ethanol), ethers (such as MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether), ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether), TAME (tertiary amyl methyl ether)); • esters (e.g. rapeseed or dimethylester, etc.); • chemical compounds (such as TML, TEL and detergents). Note: Quantities of additives/oxygenates (alcohols, ethers, esters and other chemical compounds) reported in this category should relate to the quantities destined for blending with fuels or for fuel use. |

4.1 | Of Which: Biofuels | Biogasoline and Biodiesels. The definitions of Chapter 5, Renewable Energy and Energy from Waste, apply. Quantities of liquid biofuels reported in this category relate to the biofuel and not to the total volume of liquids into which the biofuels are blended. Excludes all trade of biofuels which have not been blended with transport fuels (i.e. in their pure form); these should be reported as per Chapter 5. The biofuels traded as part of transport fuels should be reported in the appropriate product indicating the biofuel portion. |

5 | Other Hydro-carbons | Synthetic crude oil from tar sands, shale oil, etc., liquids from coal liquefaction, (see Chapter 1), output of liquids from natural gas conversion into gasoline (see Chapter 2), hydrogen and emulsified oils (e.g. Orimulsion). Excludes oil shale production, for which Chapter 1 applies. The production of shale oil (secondary product) is to be reported as “From other sources” in the “Other hydrocarbons category”. |

6 | Refinery Gas (not liquefied) | Refinery gas includes a mixture of non-condensible gases mainly consisting of hydrogen, methane, ethane and olefins obtained during distillation of crude oil or treatment of oil products (e.g. cracking) in refineries. This also includes gases which are returned from the petrochemical industry. |

7 | Ethane | A naturally gaseous straight-chain hydrocarbon, (C2H6) extracted from natural gas and refinery gas streams. |

Naphtha comprises material in the 30°C and 210°C distillation range or part of this range. |

10 | Motor Gasoline | Motor gasoline consists of a mixture of light hydrocarbons distilling between 35°C and 215°C. It is used as a fuel for land based spark ignition engines. Motor gasoline may include additives, oxygenates and octane enhancers, including lead compounds such as TEL and TML. Includes motor gasoline blending components (excluding additives/ oxygenates), e.g. alkylates, isomerate, reformate, cracked gasoline destined for use as finished motor gasoline. |

12 | Gasoline Type Jet Fuel (Naphtha Type Jet Fuel or JP4) | This includes all light hydrocarbon oils for use in aviation turbine power units, distilling between 100°C and 250°C. They are obtained by blending kerosenes and gasoline or naphthas in such a way that the aromatic content does not exceed 25% in volume, and the vapour pressure is between 13.7kPa and 20.6kPa. |

13 | Kerosene Type Jet Fuel | Distillate used for aviation turbine power units. It has the same distillation characteristics between 150°C and 300°C (generally not above 250°C) and flash point as kerosene. In addition, it has particular specifications (such as freezing point) which are established by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Includes kerosene blending components. |

14 | Other Kerosene | Refined petroleum distillate used in sectors other than aircraft transport. It distils between 150°C and 300°C. |

15 | Gas/Diesel Oil (Distillate Fuel Oil) | Gas/diesel oil is primarily a medium distillate distilling between 180°C and 380°C. Includes blending components. Several grades are available depending on uses: |

17 | White Spirit And SBP | Refined distillate intermediates with a distillation in the naphtha/kerosene range. They are sub-divided as: - Industrial Spirit (SBP): Light oils distilling between 30°C and 200°C. There are 7 or 8 grades of industrial spirit, depending on the position of the cut in the distillation range. The grades are defined according to the temperature difference between the 5% volume and 90% volume distillation points (which is not more than 60°C). - White Spirit: Industrial spirit with a flash point above 30°C. The distillation range of white spirit is 135°C to 200°C. |

18 | Lubricants | Hydrocarbons produced from distillate by product; they are mainly used to reduce friction between bearing surfaces. Includes all finished grades of lubricating oil, from spindle oil to cylinder oil, and those used in greases, motor oils and all grades of lubricating oil base stocks. |

19 | Bitumen | Solid, semi-solid or viscous hydrocarbon with a colloidal structure, being brown to black in colour, obtained as a residue in the distillation of crude oil, by vacuum distillation of oil residues from atmospheric distillation.

It consists mainly of carbon (90 to 95%) and has a low ash content. It is used as a feedstock in coke ovens for the steel industry, for heating purposes, for electrode manufacture and for production of chemicals. The two most important qualities are "green coke" and "calcinated coke". Includes "catalyst coke" deposited on the catalyst during refining processes; this coke is not recoverable and is usually burned as refinery fuel. |

22 | Other Products | All products not specifically mentioned above, for example: tar and sulphur. Includes aromatics (e.g. BTX or benzene, toluene and xylene) and olefins (e.g. propylene) produced within refineries. |
