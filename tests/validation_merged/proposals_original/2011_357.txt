Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to the making available on the market of electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits /* COM/2011/0773 final - 2011/0357 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.                      context of the proposal

General context, reasons for andobjectives of this proposal

This proposal is presented in the frameworkof the implementation of the “goods package” adopted in 2008. It is partof a package of proposals aligning ten product directives to Decision No768/2008/EC establishinga common framework for the marketing of products.

Union (EU) harmonisation legislationensuring the free movement of products has contributed considerably to thecompletion and operation of the Single Market. It is based on a high level ofprotection and provides economic operators with the means to demonstrateconformity, thus ensuring free movement through trust in the products.

Directive 2006/95/EC is an example of thatUnion harmonisation legislation, ensuring the free movement of electricalequipment. It sets out the safety objectives that electrical equipment mustcomply with in order to be made available on the EU market. Manufacturers mustdemonstrate that electrical equipment has been designed and manufactured incompliance with the safety objectives and affix the CE marking.

Experience with the implementation of Unionharmonisation legislation has shown – on a cross-sector scale - certainweaknesses and inconsistencies in the implementation and enforcement of thislegislation, leading to

–     the presence of non-compliant or dangerousproducts on the market and consequently a certain lack of trust in CE marking

–     competitive disadvantages for economic operatorscomplying with the legislation as opposed to those circumventing the rules

–     unequal treatment in the case of non-compliantproducts and distortion of competition amongst economic operators due todifferent enforcement practices

–     differing practices in the designation ofconformity assessment bodies by national authorities

Furthermore the regulatory environment hasbecome more and more complex, as frequently several pieces of legislation applysimultaneously to one and the same product. Inconsistencies in these pieces oflegislation make it increasingly difficult for economic operators andauthorities to correctly interpret and apply that legislation.

To remedy these horizontal shortcomings inUnion harmonisation legislation observed across several industrial sectors, the“New Legislative Framework” was adopted in 2008 as part of the goodspackage. Its objective is to strengthen andcomplete the existing rules and to improve practical aspects of theirapplication and enforcement. The New Legislative Framework (NLF) consists oftwo complementary instruments, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 onaccreditation and market surveillance and Decision No 768/2008/ECestablishing a common framework for the marketing of products.

The NLF Regulation has introduced rules onaccreditation (a tool for the evaluation of competence of conformity assessmentbodies) and requirements for the organisation and performance of marketsurveillance and controls of products from third countries. Since 1 January2010 these rules apply directly in all Member States.

The NLF Decision sets out a commonframework for EU product harmonisation legislation. This framework consists ofthe provisions which are commonly used in EU product legislation (e.g.definitions, obligations of economic operators, safeguard mechanisms, etc).These common provisions have been reinforced to ensure that the directives canbe applied and enforced more effectively in practice. New elements, such asobligations on importers, have been introduced, which are crucial for improvingthe safety of products on the market.

The provisions of the NLF Decision andthose of the NLF Regulation are complementary and closely interlinked. The NLFDecision contains the corresponding obligations for economic operators allowingmarket surveillance authorities to properly perform the tasks imposed on themby the NLF Regulation and to ensure an effective and consistent enforcement ofEU product legislation.

However, unlike the NLF Regulation, theprovisions of the NLF Decision are not directly applicable. To ensure that alleconomic sectors subject to Union harmonisation legislation benefit from theimprovements of the NLF, the provisions of the NLF Decision need to beintegrated into the existing product legislation.

A survey after the adoption of the goodspackage in 2008 showed that a majority of Union harmonisation legislation onproducts was due to be revised within the following 3 years, not only toaddress the problems observed throughout all sectors but also forsector-specific reasons. Any such revision would automatically include analignment of the legislation concerned to the NLF Decision since Parliament, Counciland Commission have committed themselves to use its provisions as much aspossible in future legislation on products in order to further the utmost coherenceof the regulatory framework.

For a number of other Union harmonisationdirectives, including Directive 2006/95/EC no revision for sector-specificproblems had been envisaged within this timeframe. To ensure that the problemsin relation to non-compliance are nevertheless addressed in these sectors, andfor the sake of consistency of the overall regulatory environment on products,it was decided to align these directives within a package to the provisions ofthe NLF Decision.

Consistency with other policies andobjectives of the Union

This initiative is inline with the Single Market Act[1],which has stressed the need to restore consumer confidence in the quality ofproducts on the market and the importance of reinforcing market surveillance.

Furthermore it supportsthe Commission’s policy on Better Regulation and simplification of theregulatory environment.

2.                      consultation of interested parties and impactassessment

Consultation of interested parties

The alignment of Directive 2006/95/EC tothe NLF Decision has been discussed with national experts responsible for theimplementation of this Directive, the administrative cooperation group as wellas in bilateral meetings with industry associations.

From June to October 2010 a publicconsultation was organised that comprised all the sectors involved in thisinitiative. It consisted of four targeted questionnaires for economicoperators, authorities, notified bodies and users and the Commission servicesreceived 300 replies. The results are published at:

http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/regulatory-policies-common-rules-for-products/new-legislative-framework/index_en.htm

In addition to the general consultation aspecific SME consultation was carried out. 603 SMEs were consulted through theEnterprise Europe Network in May/June 2010. The results are available at http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/files/new-legislative-framework/smes_statistics_en.pdf

The consultation process revealedwidespread support for the initiative. There is unanimity on the need toimprove market surveillance and the system for assessing and monitoringNotified Bodies. Authorities fully support the exercise because it willstrengthen the existing system and improve cooperation at EU level. Industryexpects a more level playing field resulting from more effective actionsagainst products that do not comply with the legislation, as well as asimplification effect from the alignment of legislation. Certain concerns wereexpressed on some obligations which are, however, indispensable for increasingthe efficiency of market surveillance. These measures will not entailsignificant costs for industry, and the benefits resulting from improved marketsurveillance should by far outweigh the costs.

Collection and use of expertise

The impact assessment for thisimplementation package has largely built on the impact assessment carried outfor the New Legislative Framework. In addition to the expertise collected andanalysed in that context, further consultation of sector-specific experts andinterest groups, as well as horizontal experts active in the area of technicalharmonisation, conformity assessment, accreditation and market surveillance,has taken place.

Impact assessment

Based on the information collected, theCommission carried out an impact assessment which examined and compared threeoptions.

Option 1 - No changes to the currentsituation

This option proposes no changes to thecurrent directive and relies exclusively on certain improvements that can beexpected from the NLF Regulation.

Option 2 – Alignment to the NLF Decisionby non-legislative measures

Option 2 considers the possibility ofencouraging a voluntary alignment to the provisions set out in the NLF Decisionby, e.g., presenting them as best practices in guidance documents.

Option 3 – Alignment to NLF Decision bylegislative measures

This option consists in integrating theprovisions of the NLF Decision into the existing Directive.

Option 3 was foundto be the preferred option because

–     it will improve the competitiveness of companiestaking their obligations seriously, as opposed to those cheating on the system;

–     it will improve the functioning of the internalmarket by ensuring equal treatment of all economic operators, notably importersand distributors;

–     it does not entail significant costs foreconomic operators; for those who are already acting responsibly, no extracosts or only negligible costs are expected;

–     it is considered more effective than option 2:due to the lack of enforceability of option 2 it is questionable that thepositive impacts would materialise under that option;

–     options 1 and 2 do not provide answers to theproblem of inconsistencies in the regulatory framework and therefore have nopositive impact on the simplification of the regulatory environment.

3.                      Main elements of the proposal3.1.                Horizontal definitions

The proposalintroduces harmonised definitions of terms which are commonly used throughoutUnion harmonisation legislation and should therefore be given a consistentmeaning throughout that legislation.

3.2.                Obligations of economic operators andtraceability requirements

The proposal clarifies the obligations ofmanufacturers and authorised representatives and introduces obligations forimporters and distributors. Importers must verify that the manufacturer hascarried out the applicable conformity assessment procedure and has drawn up atechnical documentation. They must also make sure with the manufacturer thatthis technical documentation can be made available to authorities upon request.Furthermore importers must verify that the electrical equipment is correctlymarked and accompanied by the required safety information. They must keep acopy of the EU declaration of conformity and indicate their name and address onthe product, or where this is not possible on the packaging or the accompanyingdocumentation. Distributors must verify that electrical equipment bears the CEmarking, the name of the manufacturer and of the importer, if relevant, andthat it is accompanied by the required documentation and instructions.

Importers and distributors must cooperatewith market surveillance authorities and take appropriate actions when theyhave supplied non-compliant electrical equipment.

Enhanced traceability obligations are introduced for all economic operators. Electrical equipment hasto bear the manufacturer’s name and address and a number allowing to identifyand link the electrical equipment to its technical documentation. When electricalequipment is imported the importer’s name and address must also be on theelectrical equipment. Furthermore every economic operator must be able toidentify towards authorities the economic operator who has supplied him withelectrical equipment or to whom he has supplied electrical equipment.

3.3.                Harmonised standards

Compliance with harmonised standardprovides a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. On 1 June2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on European Standardisation[2] that sets out a horizontallegal framework for European standardisation. The proposal for the Regulationcontains inter alia provisions on standardisation requests from the Commissionto the European Standardisation Organisations, on the procedure for objectionsto harmonised standards and on stakeholder participation in the standardisationprocess. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC which cover thesame aspects have been deleted in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty.

The provision conferring presumption ofconformity to harmonised standards has been modified to clarify the extent ofthe presumption of conformity when standards only partially cover the essentialrequirements.

3.4.                Conformity assessment and CE marking

Directive 2006/95/EC has selected theappropriate conformity assessment procedure which manufacturers have to applyin order to demonstrate that their electrical equipment comply with the safetyobjectives. The proposal aligns these procedures to their updated versions setout in the NLF Decision. It also introduces a model for the EU declaration ofconformity.

General principles of the CE marking areset out in Article 30 of Regulation 765/2008, while the detailed provisions onthe affixing of the CE marking to electrical equipment have been inserted in this proposal.

3.5.                Market surveillance and the safeguard clauseprocedure

The proposal revises the existing safeguardclause procedure. It introduces a phase of information exchange between MemberStates, and specifies the steps to be taken by the authorities concerned, whena non-compliant electrical equipment is found. A real safeguard clauseprocedure – leading to a Decision at Commission level on whether a measure isjustified or not - is only launched when another Member State objects to ameasure taken against an electrical equipment. Where there is no disagreementon the restrictive measure taken, all Member States must take the appropriateaction on their territory.

4.                      legal elements of the proposal

Legal basis

The proposal is based on Article 114 of theTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Subsidiarity principle

The internal market is a competence that isshared between the Union and the Member States. The subsidiarity principlearises in particular with regard to the newly added provisions aiming at theimprovement of effective enforcement of Directive 2006/95/EC namely, theimporter and distributor obligations, the traceability provisions, theprovisions on the assessment, and the enhanced cooperation obligations in thecontext of the revised market surveillance and safeguard procedures.

Experience with the enforcement of thelegislation has shown that measures taken at national level have led todivergent approaches and to a different treatment of economic operators insidethe EU, which undermines the objective of this directive. If actions are takenat national level to address the problems, this risks creating obstacles to thefree movement of goods. Furthermore action at national level is limited to theterritorial competence of a Member State. In view of the increasinginternationalisation of trade, the number of cross-border cases is constantlyrising. Coordinated action at EU level can much better achieve the objectivesset, and will in particular render market surveillance more effective. Hence itis more appropriate to take action at EU level.

As regards the problem of inconsistenciesthroughout the directives, this is a problem which can only be solved by the EUlegislator.

Proportionality

In accordance with the principle ofproportionality, the proposed modifications do not go beyond what is necessaryto achieve the objectives set.

The new or modified obligations do notimpose unnecessary burdens and costs on industry - especially on small and mediumsized enterprises - or administrations. Where modifications have been identifiedto have negative impacts, the analysis of the impacts of the option serves toprovide the most proportionate response to the problems identified. A number ofmodifications concern the improvement of clarity of the existing Directivewithout introducing new requirements that entail added cost.

Legislative technique used

The alignment to the NLF Decision requiresa number of substantive amendments to the provisions of Directive 2006/95/EC. Toensure the readability of the amended text the technique of recasting has beenchosen in line with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 28 November 2001 on amore structured use of the recasting technique for legal acts[3].

The changes made to the provisions ofDirective 2006/95/EC concern: the definitions, the obligations of economicoperators, the presumption of conformity provided by harmonised standards, thedeclaration of conformity, CE marking, the safeguard clause procedure and the conformityassessment procedures.

The proposal does not change the scope andthe safety objectives of Directive 2006/95.

5.                      budgetary implications

This proposal does not have anyimplications for the EU budget.

6.                      additional information

Repeal of existing legislation

The adoption of the proposal will lead torepeal of Directive 2006/95/EC.

European Economic Area

The proposal concerns the EEA and shouldtherefore be extended to the European Economic Area.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the EuropeanCommunity Ö on theFunctioning of the European Union Õ , and in particularArticle 95Ö 114 Õ thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

ò new

(1)              Anumber of substantive changes are to be made to Directive 2006/95/EC of the European Parliament andof the Council of 12 December 2006 on the harmonisation of the laws of MemberStates relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltagelimits[5]. In the interests of clarity, that Directiveshould be recast.

(2)              Regulation (EC) No765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 settingout the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to themarketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93[6] lays down rules on the accreditationof conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the marketsurveillance of products and for controls of products from third countries, andlays down the general principles of the CE marking.

(3)              Decision No768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on acommon framework for the marketing of products and repealing Council Decision93/465/EEC[7]lays down a common framework of general principles and reference provisionsintended to apply across the legislation harmonising the conditions for themarketing of products in order to provide a coherent basis for revision orrecasts of that legislation. Directive 2006/95/EC should therefore be adaptedto that Decision.

ê 2006/95 recital 1 (adapted)

Council Directive 73/23/EEC of 19 February1973 on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating toelectrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits [8] hasbeen substantially amended[9]. In theinterests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.

ê 2006/95 recital2

The provisions inforce in the Member States designed to ensure safety in the use of electricalequipment used within certain voltage limits may differ, thus impeding trade.

ê 2006/95recital 3

In certain MemberStates in respect of certain electrical equipment, the safety legislationtakes the form of preventive and repressive measures by means of bindingprovisions.

ê 2006/95recital 4

In other MemberStates in order to achieve the same objective, the safety legislationprovides for reference to technical standards laid down by Standards Bodies.Such a system offers the advantage of rapid adjustment to technical progresswithout neglecting safety requirements.

ê 2006/95 recital5

Certain MemberStates carry out administrative operations to approve standards. Suchapproval neither affects the technical content of the standards in any way norlimits their conditions of use. Such approval cannot therefore alter theeffects, from a Community point of view, ofharmonised and published standards.

ê 2006/95recital 6

Within theCommunity, the free movement of electrical equipment should follow when thisequipment complies with certain safety requirements recognised in all MemberStates. Without prejudice to any other form of proof, the proof ofcompliance with these requirements may be established by reference toharmonised standards which incorporate these conditions. These harmonisedstandards should be established by common agreement by bodies to be notified by each Member State to theother Member States and to the Commission and should be publicised as widely aspossible. Such harmonisation should, for the purposes of trade, eliminate theinconveniences resulting from differences between national standards

ê 2006/95 recital7

Without prejudiceto any other form of proof, the compliance of electrical equipment with theharmonised standards may be presumed from the affixing or issue of marks orcertificates by the competent organisations or, in the absence thereof, froma manufacturer's declaration of compliance. In order to facilitate the removalof barriers to trade, the Member States should recognise such marks orcertificates or such declaration as elements of proof. With this end in view, the said marks or certificatesshould be publicised in particular by their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

ò new

(4)              Economic operatorsshould be responsible for the compliance of electrical equipment in relation totheir respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level ofprotection of public interests, such as health and safety, and the protectionof consumers and to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.

(5)              All economic operatorsintervening in the supply and distribution chain should take the appropriatemeasures to ensure that they only make available on the market electricalequipment which is in conformity with this Directive. It is necessary toprovide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations whichcorrespond to the role of each operator in the supply and distribution process.

(6)              The manufacturer,having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placedto carry out the complete conformity assessment procedure for electricalequipment. Conformity assessment should therefore remain the obligation of themanufacturer alone.

(7)              Although conformityassessment should be the responsibility of the manufacturer without any need toinvolve an independent conformity assessment body, in order to facilitate thecompletion of the conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers should beallowed to seek assistance of an independent conformity assessment laboratory.

(8)              It is necessary toensure that electrical equipment from third countries entering the Union marketcomply with the requirements of this Directive, and in particular thatappropriate assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers withregard to this electrical equipment. Provision should therefore be made forimporters to make sure that electrical equipment they place on the marketcomply with the requirements of this Directive and that they do not place onthe market electrical equipment which does not comply with such requirements orpresent a risk. Provision should also be made for importers to make sure thatconformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that product markingand documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by thesupervisory authorities.

(9)              The distributor makeselectrical equipment available on the market after it has been placed on themarket by the manufacturer or the importer and should act with due care toensure that its handling of electrical equipment does not adversely affect thecompliance of the electrical equipment.

(10)          When placingelectrical equipment on the market, every importer should indicate on theelectrical equipment his name and the address at which he can be contacted.Exceptions should be provided for in cases where the size or nature of the electricalequipment does not allow it. This includes cases where the importer would haveto open the packaging to put his name and address on the product.

(11)          Any economic operatorthat either places electrical equipment on the market under his own name ortrademark or modifies electrical equipment in such a way that compliance withthe requirements of this Directive may be affected should be considered to bethe manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.

(12)          Distributors andimporters, being close to the market place, should be involved in marketsurveillance tasks carried out by the competent national authorities, andshould be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities withall necessary information relating to the electrical equipment concerned.

(13)          Ensuring traceabilityof electrical equipment throughout the whole supply chain helps to make marketsurveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability systemfacilitates market surveillance authorities' task of tracing economic operatorswho made non-compliant products available on the market.

(14)          This Directive shouldbe limited to the expression of the safety objectives. In order to facilitateconformity assessment with those objectives it is necessary to provide forpresumption of conformity for electrical equipment which is in conformity withharmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No[../..] of the European Parliament and of the Council of […..] on EuropeanStandardisation and amendingCouncil Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC,95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/105/EC and2009/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council for the purpose of expressing detailedtechnical specifications of those objectives.

(15)          Regulation (EU) No[../..] [on European Standardisation] provides for a procedure for objectionsto harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely satisfyrequirements of this Directive.

ê 2006/95recital 9

It is possiblethat electrical equipment may be placed in free circulation even though it doesnot comply with the safety requirements, and it is therefore desirable to laydown suitable provisions to minimise this danger

ê 2006/95recital 10 (new)

Council Decision93/465/EEC[10] establishes the modules for the various phases ofthe conformity assessment procedures which are intended to be used in thetechnical harmonisation Directives.

ê 2006/95recital 11

The choice ofprocedures should not lead to a lowering of safety standards of electricalequipment, which have already been established throughout the Community.

ò new

(17)          In order to enableeconomic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that electricalequipment made available on the market is in conformity with the safety objectivesit is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, whichinclude procedures from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to thelevel of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensureinter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants, conformity assessmentprocedures should be chosen from among those modules.

(18)          Manufacturers shoulddraw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide detailed information on theconformity of electrical equipment with the requirements of this Directive andof the other relevant Union harmonisation legislation.

(19)          The CE marking,indicating the conformity of electrical equipment, is the visible consequenceof a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. Generalprinciples governing the CE marking are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking should be laid down in this Directive.

(20)          In order to ensurelegal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on Union marketsurveillance and control of products entering the Union market provided for inRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to electrical equipment. This Directiveshould not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities thatcarry out those tasks.

(21)          Directive 2006/95/ECalready provides for a safeguard procedure which applies only in the event ofdisagreement between Member States over measures taken by a Member State. Inorder to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessaryto improve the existing safeguard clause procedure, with a view to making itmore efficient and drawing on the expertise available in Member States.

(22)          The existing systemshould be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties areinformed of measures intended to be taken with regard to products presenting arisk to the health and safety of persons or to other aspects of public interestprotection. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, incooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an earlier stage inrespect of such products.

(23)          Where the MemberStates and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by aMember State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required,except where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonisedstandard.

(24)          Member States should laydown rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisionsadopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Thosepenalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

(25)          Itis necessary to provide for transitional arrangements that allow makingavailable on the market electrical equipment which has already been placed onthe market in accordance with Directive 2006/95/EC.

(26)          Sincethe objective of this Directive, namely to ensure that electrical equipment onthe market fulfil the requirements providing a high level of protection ofhealth and safety and other public interests while guaranteeing the functioningof the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States andcan therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Unionlevel, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle ofsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. Inaccordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article,this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve thatobjective.

(27)          Theobligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined tothose provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with theDirective 2006/95/EC. The obligation to transpose the provisionswhich are unchanged arises under the earlier Directive.
