Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund covered by the Common Strategic Framework and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 /* COM/2011/0615 final - 2011/0276 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.                      CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

On 29 June 2011, the Commission adopted aproposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020:A Budget for Europe 2020[1]. Simplification of policy delivery, focus on results and increaseduse of conditionality are among the major hallmarks of the next set ofprogrammes.

Simplification has been defined as a keyobjective in the EU Budget Review Communication[2], the Smart Regulation agenda[3] and the aforesaid communication on the next multi-annual financialframework. Experience suggests that in the current programming period, thediversity and fragmentation of rules governing spending programmes are oftenperceived as unnecessarily complicated and difficult to implement and control. Thisimposes a heavy administrative burden on beneficiaries as well as on theCommission and Member States, which can have the unintended effect ofdiscouraging participation, increasing error rates and delaying implementation.This means that the potential benefits of EU programmes are not fully realised.

The European Regional Development Fund(ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF), the EuropeanAgricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the future EuropeanMaritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) (hereinafter referred to as the 'CSF Funds')pursue complementary policy objectives and their management is shared betweenthe Member States and the Commission. It is therefore important to maximise theeffectiveness of all structural instruments in terms of delivering objectivesand targets set in programmes and optimise synergies and efficiency of thedifferent instruments. This will be achieved through sound policy, regulatoryand institutional framework conditions for the funds, an increased focus onresults and monitoring progress towards objectives and targets agreed inprogrammes as well as the harmonisation, to the extent possible, ofimplementation rules and control requirements.

Against this background, this Regulation deliversa common set of basic rules. It is divided into two parts.

The first part sets out a series of commonprovisions governing all structural instruments covered by the Common StrategicFramework. These provisions concern the general principles of support such aspartnership, multi-level governance, equality between men and women,sustainability and compliance with applicable EU and national law. The proposalalso contains the common elements of strategic planning and programming,including a list of joint thematic objectives derived from the Europe 2020 Strategy,provisions on the Common Strategic Framework at Union level and on PartnershipContracts to be concluded with each Member State. It sets out a common approachto reinforce the performance orientation of the cohesion policy, the ruraldevelopment policy and the maritime and fisheries policy and therefore includesprovisions concerning conditionalities and performance review, but also thearrangements for monitoring, reporting and evaluation. Common provisionsconcerning the implementation of CSF Funds are also set out with regard toeligibility rules, and special arrangements are defined for financialinstruments and community led local development. Some management and controlarrangements are also common for all CSF Funds.

The second part includes specificprovisions set out for the ERDF, the ESF and the CF. These include provisionsrelated to the mission and goals of cohesion policy, the financial framework,specific programming and reporting arrangements, major projects and jointaction plans. The second part sets out the requirements on management andcontrol systems under cohesion policy and elaborates the specific arrangementsfor control and financial management.

At the same time, the Commission willensure that synergies already obtained through simplification and harmonisationof the first pillar (EAGF – European Agricultural Guarantee Fund) and thesecond pillar (EAFRD) of the Common Agriculture Policy are preserved. Thestrong link between the EAGF and the EAFRD will therefore be maintained and thestructures already in place in the Member States will be sustained.

2.                      RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIESAND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS2.1.                Consultations and expert advice

The Regulation draws on extensiveconsultations with stakeholders, including Member States, regions, social andeconomic partners, academic experts and international institutions in thecontext of the preparation of the proposal for each structural fund for the2014-2020 financial framework. The results of the ex post evaluationscarried out on the 2000-2006 programmes; and a broad range of studies andexpert advice were used as input.

For the next cohesion policy framework,expert advice was provided by the High Level Group reflecting on futureCohesion Policy, with 10 meetings held between 2009 and 2011, an informalplatform established to support the work of the Commission in developing thefuture directions of cohesion policy as well as a TaskForce on Conditionality, which met three times in early 2011. A publicconsultation on the conclusions of the Fifth Cohesion Report was held between12 November 2010 and 31 January 2011. A total of 444 contributions werereceived. A summary of the results was published on 13 May 2011[4].

On the future of rural development, apublic consultation was held between 23 November 2010 and 25 January 2011 andan advisory committee with stakeholders was organised on 12 January 2011.[5] Altogether, 517 contributions were received by the Commission. Of thecontributions from organisations, 44% came from the farming and processingsector and 40% from national, regional and local authorities, environmentalorganisations, think-tanks and research institutes as well as, developmentorganisations, the trade sector, and consumer organisations. Otherorganisations (12%) participating in the consultation included healthprotection organisations, water management bodies and civil societyrepresentations.

On reform of the common fisheries policy, aGreen Paper was adopted in April 2009[6], followed by a public consultation. In addition to the publicconsultation, approximately 200 meetings with Member States, the AdvisoryCommittee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA) and the Regional AdvisoryCouncils (RACs), the fishing industry, the processing and marketing sector,trade unions, NGOs, and the research community were organized. In particular:(i) two meetings with the Member States, during which future funding wasdiscussed, took place in Gent (12-14 September 2010) and Noordwijk (9-11 March2011); (ii) a dedicated seminar on the future European Fisheries Fund with theparticipation of stakeholders from industry, trade unions and Member States wasorganised on 13 April 2010, in Brussels; (iii) a conference on the future oflocal development in fisheries areas took place in Brussels (12-13 April 2011).

A number of common conclusions can be drawnfrom the results of the different public consultations which confirmed thefollowing:

–     A majority of stakeholders called for continuedfinancial support of these policies;

–     EU support should focus on a number ofpriorities and the different policies should be aligned with the Europe 2020 Strategy;

–     For cohesion policy in particular, stakeholderscalled for a more results-oriented approach and there was strong support for amore transparent and simplified set of financial management procedures;

A majority of stakeholders called for a moreintegrated approach or joined-up strategies with other EU policies andfinancial instruments.

2.2.                Impact assessment

This proposal draws on three ImpactAssessments: one carried out for the ERDF, the CF and the ESF together; and oneeach for the EAFRD and for the EMFF. These impact assessments analysed issuesincluding EU added value, performance and delivery of the policies, as well assimplification and harmonisation of rules. The options assessed in the impactassessments related to (i) improving the capacity of the policies to deliverEuropean added value, (ii) increasing the performance of the policies and (iii)simplification – reducing administrative costs and minimising the risk error.

2.2.1.          Delivering European added value

To be able to deliver greater Europeanadded value, the structural programmes need to both: a) concentrate theirsupport on EU priorities and b) coordinate with other EU policies and financialinstruments. The Europe 2020 Strategy provides a clear set of commonobjectives, including headline targets and flagship initiatives, as a clearframework for identification of funding priorities. There is broad consensusamong stakeholders on the role of the different policies (cohesion policy,rural development policy and maritime and fisheries policy) in contributing tothe achievement of the Europe 2020 Strategy[7].

As for concentration on EU priorities, theoptions assessed included a flexible approach to concentration by earmarkingprovisions; a more visible and comprehensive link with the Europe 2020 headlinetargets and the Integrated Guidelines, ensuring a critical mass for the ESFand, thirdly, concentration on EU priorities in less developed Member Statesonly. The preferred option is to establish a strong link to Europe 2020 targetswhich would contribute most to reaching the headline targets.

As for coordination with other EU policiesand financial instruments, the options examined included a loose alignmentbased on non-binding Community Strategic Guidelines, a more comprehensivealignment with the Europe 2020 objectives through the Common StrategicFramework and Partnership Contract, and no alignment with other EU policies andfinancial instruments beyond formal compliance. Strategic planning arrangementswhich include the Common Strategic Framework at Union level and PartnershipContracts at national level are considered to ensure effective coordinationbetween Union policies and instruments.

2.2.2.          Increasing the performance of the policy

The effectiveness of the differentstructural instruments depends on sound policy, regulatory and institutionalframeworks. In many sectors, a combination of strategicand regulatory conditions and public investment is needed to addressbottlenecks to growth effectively. The options examinedin this context related to: a) the status quo (macro-fiscal conditionalityunder the CF, compliance with procedures and with EU sectoral legislation andstrategic frameworks, albeit unsystematically applied, no provisions related toperformance; b) ex ante conditionalities to be fulfilled prior to theadoption of the programmes; c) ex post conditionalities including theperformance framework and performance reserve; d) strengthened macro-fiscalconditionality; and e) combined option. The preferred option was the combinedoption since this option would allow addressing the preconditions necessary forthe effective use of the CSF Funds and would provide incentives to attainpredefined objectives and targets and align the implementation of programmeswith the Union's economic governance.

2.2.3.          Simplification - reducing administrative costsand minimising the risk error

Sound, effectiveand efficient management of the structural instruments requires appropriate,effective and transparent systems involving all the different administrationsconcerned. These systems need to ensure the selection of high qualityoperations and the effective implementation of these operations to achieve theobjectives of the policy. The management and control systems must also ensurethe prevention and detection of irregularities, including fraud, and thusreasonable assurance on the regularity of expenditure. At the same time thedelivery system should be as simple and streamlined as possible to ensureefficient implementation and the reduction of administrative burden forbeneficiaries

The options examined for cohesion policyincluded different reimbursement options (based on real costs and simplifiedcost options), eGovernance and assurance. The main differences between theoptions relate to the level of Commission involvement in the assessment ofmanagement and control systems, to the availability of reimbursement optionslinked to results, and to the mechanisms for promoting eGovernance in the dayto day management of EU funds. A proportional approach entailing risk basedcontrol arrangements, the availability of a wide range of reimbursementoptions, and advanced eGovernance at the level of Member States and regions isthe preferred option since it could lead to a significant potential reductionin the cost of controls and a decline in workload and would also comply better withthe subsidiarity principle.

3.                      LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL

EU action is justified both on the groundsof the objectives laid out in Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning ofthe European Union (TFEU) and the subsidiarity principle. The right toact is enshrined in Article 175 of the TFEU which explicitly calls on the Unionto implement this policy by means of Structural Funds, in conjunction with Article177, which defines the role of the CF. The aims of the ESF, ERDF and the CF aredefined in Articles 162, 176 and 177 of the TFEU respectively. The actionsrelated to agriculture and fisheries are justified by Articles 38 and 39 of theTFEU.

Article 174 of the TFEU states thatparticular attention shall be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrialtransition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural ordemographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low populationdensity and island, cross-border and mountain regions.

Article 349 of the TFEU states that specificmeasures shall be adopted to take account of the structural social and economicsituation of the outermost regions, which is compounded by certain specificfeatures which severely restrain their development.

4.                      BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

The Commission's proposal for a multi-annual financialframework foresees an amount of EUR 376 billion for economic, social andterritorial cohesion for the period 2014-2020.

Proposed budget 2014-2020 || EUR billion

Less developed regions Transition regions More developed regions Territorial cooperation Cohesion Fund Extra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions || 162,6 38,9 53,1 11,7 68,7 0,926

Connecting Europe Facility for transport, energy and ICT || 40 (with an additional EUR 10 billion ring fenced inside the Cohesion Fund)

*All figures inconstant 2011 prices

The Commission's proposal has alsoestablished, with the aim of enhancing the contribution of the CSF Funds indelivering on the headline targets of the Europe 2020 Strategy, minimum sharesfor the ESF for each category of regions. The application of the shares resultin a minimum overall share for the ESF of 25% of the budget allocated to cohesionpolicy, i.e. EUR 84 billion. It is however important to note that theindicated minimum ESF allocation includes the budget for a forthcomingCommission proposal regarding food support for the most deprived persons.

The Commission's proposal for the financingof the EAFRD and the EMFF will be included in the Fund-specific regulations foreach Fund.

5.                      SUMMARY OF THE CONTENT OF THE REGULATION5.1.                Common provisions governing all CSF Funds 5.1.1.          General principles

The general principles governing thesupport of all CSF Funds will include partnership and multi-level governance,compliance with applicable EU and national law, promotion of equality between menand women and sustainable development.

Within this context, for the ESF, theCommission will continue to be assisted by the Committee foreseen in Article163 of the Treaty and composed of one government representative, onerepresentative of the workers' organisations and one representative of theemployers' organisations from each Member State.

5.1.2.          Strategic approach

In order to maximise the impact of thepolicy in delivering European priorities, the Commission proposes to reinforcethe strategic programming process. This involves defining a list of thematicobjectives in the Regulation in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy:

(1)          strengthening research,technological development and innovation;

(2)          enhancing access to and use andquality of information and communication technologies;

(3)          enhancing the competitiveness ofsmall and medium-sized enterprises, the agricultural sector (for the EAFRD) andfisheries and aquaculture sector (for the EMFF);

(4)          supporting the shift towards alow-carbon economy in all sectors;

(5)          promoting climate changeadaptation, risk prevention and management;

(6)          protecting the environment andpromoting resource efficiency;

(7)          promoting sustainable transportand removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures;

(8)          promoting employment andsupporting labour mobility;

(9)          promoting social inclusion andcombating poverty;

(10)        investing in education, skills andlifelong learning;

(11)        enhancing institutional capacityand an efficient public administration.

The Common Strategic Framework willtranslate the objectives and targets of the Union priorities of smart,sustainable and inclusive growth into key actions for the ERDF, the CF, the ESF,the EAFRD and the EMFF which will ensure an integrated use of the CSF Funds todeliver common objectives.

Partnership Contracts between theCommission and each Member State will set out the commitments of partners atnational and regional level and the Commission. They will be linked to theobjectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the National Reform Programmes. Theywill set out an integrated approach for territorial development supported byall the CSF Funds and include objectives based on agreed indicators, strategicinvestments and a number of conditionalities. They will contain commitments togive yearly account of progress in the annual reports on cohesion policy, onrural development policy and in other public reporting.

5.1.3.          Conditionalities and performance

To reinforce performance, newconditionality provisions will be introduced to ensure that EU funding createsstrong incentives for Member States to deliver Europe 2020 objectives andtargets. Conditionality will take the form of both ‘ex ante’ conditionsthat must be in place before funds are disbursed and 'ex post'conditions that will make the release of additional funds contingent onperformance.

The rationale for strengthening 'ex ante'conditionality for these funds is to ensure that the conditions necessary fortheir effective support are in place. Past experience suggests that the effectivenessof investments financed by the funds have in some instances been undermined bybottlenecks in policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks. The concept ofconditionality is not a new concept within the framework of cohesion policy.Over successive programming periods, a number of mechanisms have beenintroduced to maximise the effectiveness of the interventions. Some are linkedto management and control disciplines while others to strategic and regulatoryframeworks as well as administrative capacity. The experiences with theapplication of conditionalities however indicate variations across programmes.A more transparent and systematic application is therefore justified.

'Ex post'conditionality will strengthen the focus on performance and the attainment ofthe Europe 2020 objectives. It will be based on the achievement of milestonesrelated to targets for outputs and results linked to Europe 2020 objectives setfor programmes in the partnership contract. 5% of the budget of the relevant fundswill be set aside and allocated, during a mid-term performance review, to theMember States whose programmes have met their milestones. In addition to theperformance reserve, failure to achieve milestones may lead to the suspensionof funds, and a serious underachievement in meeting targets for a programme maygive rise to a cancellation of funds.

To ensure that the effectiveness of thefunds is not undermined by unsound macro-fiscal policies, the Commissionproposes to reinforce the rules governing the Funds on macro-fiscalconditionality and align them with the new Stability and Growth Pact enforcementmeasures to be adopted as part of the Sixth Economic Governance Package.

At the same time, a higher co-financingrate (by 10 percentage points) can be applied when a Member State is receivingfinancial assistance in accordance with Articles 136 and 143 of the TFEU, thusreducing the effort required from national budgets at a time of fiscalconsolidation, while keeping the same overall level of EU funding.

5.1.4.          Common management arrangements

The proposal envisages a management andcontrol system which is similar across shared management instruments and isbased on common principles. A system of national accreditation is put in placeto emphasize the commitment of Member States to sound financial management. Thearrangements underpinning the assurance of the Commission with regard to theregularity of expenditure have been harmonised and new common elements such asa management declaration of assurance and annual clearance of accounts havebeen introduced to reinforce assurance.

5.1.5.          Community-led local development

Member States will have the possibility touse common processes for preparation, negotiation, management andimplementation, and will be encouraged to do so in particular where the needfor improved coordination of human capital and infrastructure investments isgreatest.

The CSF Fundsneed to address multiple development needs at sub-regional and local level. Tofacilitate the implementation of multi-dimensional and cross-sectoralinterventions, the Commission proposes to strengthen community-led initiatives,facilitate the implementation of integrated local development strategies andformation of local action groups, based on the experience of the LEADER approach.

5.1.6.          Financial instruments

In addition to grant funding, it isproposed that support for enterprises and projects expected to generatesubstantial financial returns will be delivered primarily through innovativefinancial instruments.

While financial instruments will remainsimilar to those employed in 2007-2013, several elements of simplificationshould be emphasized. First, the Commission will offer ready made solutionsthrough access to financial instruments set up at EU level and models fornational and regional funds based on standard terms and conditions laid down bythe Commission. Second, the proposal represents a clear framework for theimplementation of these instruments, and addresses the ambiguities which arosein the context the 2007-2013 legislative framework, increasing legal certaintyfor all parties. Third, financial instruments can in the future be used for alltypes of investment and beneficiary representing a significant extension of thepossibilities to use these innovative instruments.

5.1.7.          Monitoring and evaluation

Common provisions for all CSF funds in thearea of monitoring and evaluation include the role and composition of themonitoring committee, annual implementation reports, annual review meetings,progress reports on the implementation of the Partnership Contract, ex anteand ex post evaluations.

5.1.8.          Simplified and streamlined eligibility rules

In the current period, many beneficiariesusing funds from different Union funding instruments are faced with differenteligibility rules which increases the complexity of management and thus alsothe risk of errors. Emphasis has therefore been placed on measures to ensurethat administrative costs are proportionate and that the administrative burdenassociated with the management of EU funds by beneficiaries is reduced. The aimis to harmonise, to the extent possible, these basic rules for instrumentsimplemented under shared management, in order to reduce the multiplicity ofrules applied on the ground. Simplified costs options such as flat rates andlump sums provide the means for Member States to introduce performance-orientedmanagement at the level of individual operations.

Common provisions on the delivery includecommon rules on eligible expenditure, the different forms of financial support,simplified costs, and durability of operations. The proposal also envisages commonprinciples for the management and control systems

In the context of the CAP, the currentrules on administrative costs and the control systems will be maintained andsustained.

5.2.                General provisions applicable to the ERDF, the ESFand the CF

Part Three ofthe Regulation defines the mission and goals of cohesion policy, thegeographical coverage of support, financial resources and principles ofassistance, programming, major projects, joint action plans, territorialdevelopment, monitoring and evaluation, information and communication,eligibility of expenditure and management and control systems.

5.2.1.          Geographical coverage of support

This includes a distinction in relation toless developed, transition and more developed regions.

Less developed regions: In accordance with the TFEU, supporting the less developed regionswill remain an important priority for cohesion policy. The catching up processof economically and socially lagging regions will require long-term sustainedefforts in a world of increasing uncertainty. This category concerns thoseregions whose GDP per capita is less than 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-27.

Transition regions: A new category of region – 'transition regions' – will beintroduced to replace the current phasing-out and phasing-in system. Thiscategory will include all regions with a GDP per capita between 75% and 90% ofthe EU-27 average.

More developed regions: While interventions in the less developed regions will remain thepriority for cohesion policy, there are important challenges that concern allMember States such as global competition in the knowledge-based economy, theshift towards the low carbon economy and social polarisation exacerbated by thecurrent economic climate. This category concerns those regions whose GDP percapita is above 90% of the average GDP of the EU-27.

All regions whoseGDP per capita for the 2007-2013 period was less than 75% of the average of theEU-25 for the reference period but whose GDP per capitahas grown to more than 75% of the EU-27 average will receive two thirds oftheir 2007-13 allocation.

Minimum shares for the ESF will beestablished for each category of regions (25% for convergence regions, 40% fortransition, and 52% for competiveness regions).

The CF will support Member States whose GNIper inhabitant is less than 90% of the EU-27 average in making investments inTEN-T transport networks and the environment. Part of the Cohesion Fundallocation (EUR 10 billion) will be ring-fenced to finance core transportnetworks under the Connecting Europe Facility

Experience with the current financialframework shows that many Member States have difficulties in absorbing largevolumes of EU funds over a limited period of time. Furthermore, the fiscalsituation in some Member States has made it more difficult to release funds toprovide national co-financing. In order to address the issue of absorption offunding the Commission is proposing a number of steps:

–                        to fix at 2,5% of GDP the capping rates forcohesion allocations;

–                        capping co-financing rates at the level of eachpriority axis within the operational programmes at 85% in less developedregions (or in certain cases, 80% and 75%) and outermost regions, 60% in transitionregions and 50% in more developed regions;

–                        to include certain conditions in the partnershipcontracts regarding the improvement of administrative capacity.

5.2.2.          Reinforced strategic programming geared towardsresults

The Commission proposes a more results-orientedprogramming process to ensure that cohesion policy programmes have a clearintervention logic, are oriented towards results, and include the appropriateprovisions for an integrated approach to development and the effectiveimplementation of the Funds. In particular, the Commission proposes tointroduce the Joint Action Plans, which are operations comprising a group ofprojects as part of an operational programme, with specific objectives, resultindicators and outputs agreed between the Member State and the Commission. Theyoffer a simplified management and control system geared towards performance.

5.2.3.          Streamlining financial management and control

Management and control system need to finda balance between the costs of management and control and the risks involved.

The Commission's role in the ex antereview of national management and control systems will be proportionate, as anobligatory review by the Commission is replaced by a risk based approach. Smallprogrammes will be exempt from a Commission review. The risk-based approachreduces administrative costs associated with small programmes and solidadministrations. It also reinforces assurance, as Commission resources can beused more efficiently and targeted to areas of higher risks.

Electronic data management can be a majorsource of reductions in administrative burden and at the same time increase thecontrollability of projects and expenditure. It is therefore proposed torequire all Member States to set up systems by the end of 2014 to enable beneficiariesto submit all information by way of electronic data exchange.

One of the complexities associated with thefinancial management system in the 2007-2013 programming period is the generalrule that all supporting documents for individual operations have to beretained until three years after the programme has been closed. The proposaltherefore foresees a mandatory annual closure of completed operations orexpenditure in the framework of the annual clearance of accounts. This aims toreduce the burden associated with a long retention period of documents forindividual beneficiaries and the risks associated with the loss of the audittrail.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

laying down common provisions on theEuropean Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the CohesionFund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the EuropeanMaritime and Fisheries Fund covered by the Common Strategic Framework andlaying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, theEuropean Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No1083/2006

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioningof the European Union, and in particular Article 177 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[8],

Having regard to the opinion of theCommittee of the Regions[9],

Having regard to the opinion of the Courtof Auditors[10],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)              Article 174 of the Treaty provides that, inorder to strengthen its economic, social and territorial cohesion, the Unionshall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of thevarious regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands,particular rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regionswhich suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps.Article 175 of the Treaty requires that the Union would support the achievementof these objectives by action it takes through the European AgriculturalGuidance and Guarantee Fund, Guidance Section, the European Social Fund, the EuropeanRegional Development Fund, the European Investment Bank and other instruments.

(2)              In line with the conclusions of the EuropeanCouncil of 17 June 2010, whereby the Union strategy for smart, sustainable andinclusive growth was adopted, the Union and Member States should implement thedelivery of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, while promoting harmoniousdevelopment of the Union and reducing regional disparities.

(3)              In order to improve coordination and harmoniseimplementation of the Funds providing support under the cohesion policy, namelythe European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF)and the Cohesion Fund (CF), with the Funds for rural development, namely theEuropean Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and for the maritimeand fisheries sector, namely the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF),common provisions should be established for all these Funds (the 'CSF Funds').In addition this Regulation contains provisions which are common for the ERDF, theESF and the CF, but do not apply to the EAFRD and the EMFF. Due to theparticularities that exist for each CSF Fund, specific rules applicable to eachCSF Fund and to the European territorial cooperation goal under the ERDF shouldbe specified in separate regulations.

(4)              As regards the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),significant synergies have already been obtained by harmonising and aligningmanagement and control rules for the first pillar (EAGF - European AgriculturalGuarantee Fund) and the second pillar (EAFRD) of the CAP. The strong linkbetween the EAGF and the EAFRD should therefore be maintained and thestructures already in place in the Member States be sustained.

(5)              The outermost regions should benefit fromspecific measures and additional funding to offset the handicaps resulting fromthe factors referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty.

(6)              To ensure correct and consistent interpretationof provisions and to contribute to the legal certainty of Member States andbeneficiaries, it is necessary to define certainterms that are used in the Regulation.

(7)              It is set out that this Regulation consists ofthree parts, of which the first contains recitals and definitions, the secondcontains rules applicable to all CSF funds and the third includes provisionsapplicable only to the ERDF, the ESF and the CF (the 'Funds').

(8)              Under Article 317 of the Treaty, and in thecontext of shared management, the conditions allowing the Commission toexercise its responsibilities for implementation of the general budget of theEuropean Union should be specified and the responsibilities of cooperation bythe Member States clarified. Those conditions should enable the Commission toobtain assurance that Member States are using the CSF Funds in a legal andregular manner and in accordance with the principle of sound financialmanagement within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulationapplicable to the general budget of the EuropeanCommunities[11]. Member States and the bodies designated by them for that purposeshould be responsible for implementing programmes at the appropriateterritorial level, in accordance with the institutional, legal and financialframework of the Member State. These provisions also ensure that attention isdrawn to the need to ensure complementarity and consistency of Unionintervention, the proportionality of administrative arrangements and a reductionof the administrative burden of beneficiaries of the CSF Funds.

(9)              For the Partnership Contract and each programmerespectively, a Member State should organise apartnership with the representatives of competent regional, local, urbanand other public authorities, economic and social partners, and bodiesrepresenting civil society, including environmental partners, non-governmentalorganisations, and bodies responsible for promoting equality andnon-discrimination. The purpose of such a partnership is to respect theprinciple of multi-level governance, ensure the ownership of plannedinterventions by stakeholders and build on the experience and know-how ofrelevant actors. The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated actsproviding for a code of conduct in order to ensure that partners are involvedin the preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of PartnershipContracts and programmes in a consistent manner

(10)          The activities of the CSF Funds and theoperations which they support should comply with applicable Union and nationallaw which is directly or indirectly linked to the implementation of theoperation.

(11)          In the context of its effort to increaseeconomic, territorial and social cohesion, the Union should, at all stages ofimplementation of the CSF Funds, aim at eliminating inequalities and promotingequality between men and women, as well as combating discrimination based onsex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexualorientation.

(12)          The objectives of the CSF Funds should bepursued in the framework of sustainable development and the Union's promotionof the aim of protecting and improving the environment as set out in Article 11and 19 of the Treaty, taking into account the polluter pays principle. The MemberStates should provide information on the support for climate change objectives inline with the ambition to devote at least 20% of the Union budget to this end, usinga methodology adopted by the Commission by implementing act.

(13)          In order to achieve the targets and objectivesof the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the CSFFunds should focus their support on a limited number of common thematicobjectives. The precise scope of each of the CSF Funds shall be set out inFunds-specific rules and may be limited to only some of the thematic objectivesdefined in this Regulation.

(14)          The Commission should adopt by delegated act aCommon Strategic Framework which translates the objectives of the Union intokey actions for the CSF Funds, in order to provide clearer strategic directionto the programming process at the level of Member States and regions. TheCommon Strategic Framework should facilitate sectoral and territorialcoordination of Union intervention under the CSF Funds and with other relevantUnion policies and instruments.

(15)          The Common Strategic Framework should thereforeestablish the key areas of support, territorial challenges to be addressed,policy objectives, priority areas for cooperation activities, coordinationmechanisms and mechanisms for coherence and consistency with the economicpolicies of Member States and the Union.

(16)          On the basis of the Common Strategic Frameworkadopted by the Commission, each Member State should prepare, in cooperationwith its partners and in dialogue with the Commission, a Partnership Contract.The Partnership Contract should translate the elements set out in the CommonStrategic Framework into the national context and set out firm commitments tothe achievement of Union objectives through the programming of the CSF Funds.

(17)          Member States should concentrate support toensure a significant contribution to the achievement of Union objectives inline with their specific national and regional development needs. Ex anteconditionalities should be defined to ensure that the necessary frameworkconditions for the effective use of Union support are in place. The fulfilmentof those ex ante conditionalities should be assessed by the Commissionin the framework of its assessment of the Partnership Contract and programmes. Incases where there is a failure to fulfil an ex ante conditionality, theCommission should have the power to suspend payments to the programme.

(18)          A performance framework should be defined foreach programme with a view to monitoring progress towards the objectives andtargets set for each programme over the course of the programming period. TheCommission should undertake a performance review in cooperation with the MemberStates in 2017 and 2019. A performance reserve shouldbe foreseen and allocated in 2019 where milestones set in the performanceframework have been attained. Due to their diversity and multi-countrycharacter, there should be no performance reserve for 'European TerritorialCooperation' programmes. In cases where the shortfall in the achievement of milestonesor targets is significant, the Commission should be able to suspend payments tothe programme or, at the end of the programming period, apply financialcorrections, in order to ensure that the Union budget is not used in a wastefulor inefficient way.

(19)          Establishing a closer link between cohesionpolicy and the economic governance of the Union will ensure that theeffectiveness of expenditure under the CSF Funds is underpinned by soundeconomic policies and that the CSF Funds can, if necessary, be redirected toaddressing the economic problems a country is facing. This process has to begradual, starting with amendments to the Partnership Contract and to theprogrammes in support of Council recommendations to address macroeconomicimbalances and social and economic difficulties. Where, despite the enhanceduse of CSF funds, a Member State fails to take effective action in the contextof the economic governance process, the Commission should have the right tosuspend all or part of the payments and commitments. Decisions on suspensionsshould be proportionate and effective, taking into account the impact of theindividual programmes for addressing the economic and social situation in therelevant Member State and previous amendments to the Partnership Contract. Whendeciding on suspensions, the Commission should also respect equality oftreatment between Member States, taking into account in particular the impactof the suspension on the economy of the Member State concerned. The suspensionsshould be lifted and funds be made available again to the Member Stateconcerned as soon as the Member State takes the necessary action.

(20)          In order to ensure focus on theachievement of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth,common elements should be defined for all programmes. In order to ensure theconsistency of programming arrangements for the CSF Funds, the procedures foradoption and amendment of programmes should be aligned. Programming shouldensure consistency with the Common Strategic Framework and PartnershipContract, coordination of the CSF Funds between themselves and with the otherexisting financial instruments and the European Investment Bank.

(21)          Territorial cohesion hasbeen added to the goals of economic and social cohesion by the Treaty, and itis necessary to address the role of cities, functional geographies andsub-regional areas facing specific geographical or demographic problems. Tothis end, to better mobilise potential at a local level, it is necessary tostrengthen and facilitate community-led local development by laying down commonrules and close coordination for all CSF Funds. Responsibility for theimplementation of local development strategies should be given to local actiongroups representing the interests of the community, as an essential principle.

(22)          Financial instruments are increasingly importantdue to their leverage effect on CSF Funds, their capacity to combine differentforms of public and private resources to support public policy objectives, andbecause revolving forms of finance make such support more sustainable over thelonger term.

(23)          Financial instruments supported by the CSF Fundsshould be used to address specific market needs in a cost effective way, inaccordance with the objectives of the programmes, and should not crowd outprivate financing. The decision to finance support measures through financialinstruments should be determined therefore on the basis of an ex anteanalysis.

(24)          Financial instruments should be designed and implementedso as to promote substantial participation by private sector investors andfinancial institutions on an appropriate risk-sharing basis. To be sufficientlyattractive to private sector, financial instruments need to be designed andimplemented in a flexible manner. Managing authorities should therefore decideon the most appropriate forms to implement financial instruments to address thespecific needs of the target regions, in accordance with the objectives of the relevantprogramme.

(25)          Managing authorities should have the possibilityto contribute resources from programmes to financial instruments set up atUnion level, or to instruments set up at regional level. Managing authoritiesshould also have the possibility to implement financial instruments directly,through specific funds or through funds of funds.

(26)          The amount of the resources paid at any timefrom the CSF Funds to financial instruments should correspond to the amountnecessary to implement planned investments and payments to final recipients,including management costs and fees, determined on the basis of business plansand cash-flow forecasts for a pre-defined period which should not exceed twoyears.

(27)          It is necessary to lay down specific rulesregarding the amounts to be accepted as eligible expenditure at closure, toensure that the amounts, including the management costs and fees, paid from theCSF Funds to financial instruments are effectively used for investments andpayments to final recipients. It is also necessary to lay down specific rulesregarding the reuse of resources attributable to the support from the CSFFunds, including the use of legacy resources after the closure of theprogrammes.

(28)          Member States should monitorprogrammes in order to review implementation and progress towards achieving theprogramme's objectives. To this end, monitoring committees should be set up andtheir composition and functions defined for CSF Funds. Joint MonitoringCommittees could be set up to facilitate coordination between the CSF Funds Inorder to ensure effectiveness, monitoring committees should be able to issuerecommendations to managing authorities regarding implementation of theprogramme and should monitor actions taken as a result of its recommendations.

(29)          Alignment of the monitoringand reporting arrangements of the CSF Funds is necessary to simplify managementarrangements at all levels. It is important to ensure proportionate reportingrequirements but also the availability of comprehensive information on progressmade at key review points. Therefore it is necessary that reportingrequirements reflect information needs in given years and are aligned with thetiming of the performance reviews.

(30)          With a view to monitoringprogress of programmes, an annual review meeting should take place between theMember State and the Commission. The Member State and the Commission shouldhowever be able to agree not to organize the meeting in order to avoidunnecessary administrative burden.

(31)          In order for the Commission to monitor progresstowards achieving Union objectives, Member States should submit progressreports on the implementation of their Partnership Contracts. On the basis ofsuch reports, the Commission should prepare a strategy report on progress in2017 and 2019.

(32)          It is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness,efficiency and impact of assistance from the CSF Funds in order to improve thequality of implementation and design of programmes, and to determine the impactof programmes in relation to the targets for the Union strategy for smartsustainable and inclusive growth and in relation to GDP and unemployment, whererelevant. The responsibilities of Member States and the Commission in thisregard should be specified.

(33)          In order to improve the quality and design of eachprogramme, and verify that objectives and targets can be reached, an ex anteevaluation of each programme should be carried out.

(34)          An evaluation plan should be drawn up by theauthority responsible for the preparation of the programme. During theprogramming period managing authorities should carry out evaluations to assessthe effectiveness and impact of a programme. The monitoring committee and theCommission should be informed about the results of evaluations to facilitatemanagement decisions.

(35)          Ex postevaluations should be carried out in order to assess the effectiveness andefficiency of the CSF Funds and their impact on the overall goals of the CSFFunds and the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

(36)          It is useful to specify thetypes of action that may be undertaken at the initiative of the Commission andof the Member States as technical assistance with support from the CSF Funds.

(37)          In order to ensure an effective use of Unionresources, and avoid the over- financing of revenue generating operations, it is necessary to set out the rules for calculating thecontribution from the CSF Funds to a revenue-generating operation.

(38)          The starting and closingdates for the eligibility of expenditure should be defined so as to provide fora uniform and equitable rule applying to the implementation of the CSF Fundsacross the Union. In order to facilitate the execution of programmes, it isappropriate to establish that the starting date for the eligibility ofexpenditure may be prior to 1 January 2014 if the Member State concernedsubmits a programme before that date. With a view to ensuring an effective useof EU Funds and reducing the risk to the EU budget, it is necessary to put inplace restrictions on support for completed operations-

(39)          In accordance with theprinciple of subsidiarity and subject to exceptions provided for inRegulation(s) (EU) No […] [ERDF, ESF, CF, ETC, EAFRD, EMFF Regulations], MemberStates should adopt national rules on the eligibility of expenditure.

(40)          With a view to simplifyingthe use of the CSF Funds and reducing the risk of errors, while providing fordifferentiation where needed to reflect the specificities of policy, it isappropriate to define the forms of support, harmonized conditions ofreimbursement of grants and flat rate financing, specific eligibility rules forgrants and specific conditions on the eligibility of operations depending onlocation.

(41)          To ensure the effectiveness,fairness and sustainable impact of the intervention of the CSF Funds, thereshould be provisions guaranteeing that investments in businesses andinfrastructures are long-lasting and prevent the CSF Funds from being used toundue advantage. Experience has shown that a period of five years is anappropriate minimum period to be applied, except where State aid rules foreseea different period. It is appropriate to exclude actions supported by the ESFand those not entailing productive investment or investment in infrastructurefrom the general requirement of durability, unless such requirements arederived from applicable State aid rules, and to exclude contributions to orfrom financial instruments.

(42)          Member States should adoptadequate measures to guarantee the proper set up and functioning of theirmanagement and control systems to give assurance on the legal and regular useof the CSF Funds. The obligations of Member States as regards the managementand control systems of programmes, and in relation to the prevention, detectionand correction of irregularities and infringements of Union law should thereforebe specified.

(43)          In accordance with the principles of sharedmanagement, Member States should have the primary responsibility, through theirmanagement and control systems, for the implementation and control of the operationsin programmes. In order to strengthen theeffectiveness of the control over the selection and implementation ofoperations and the functioning of the management and control system, thefunctions of the managing authority should be specified.

(44)          In order to provide assurance ex ante onthe set up and design of the main systems of management and control, MemberStates should designate an accrediting body that is responsible for theaccreditation and withdrawal of accreditation of managing and control bodies.

(45)          The powers and responsibilities of the Commission to verify the effective functioning of themanagement and control systems, and to require Member State action, should belaid down. The Commission should also have the power to carry out auditsfocused on issues relating to sound financial management in order to drawconclusions on the performance of Funds.

(46)          Union budget commitments should be effectedannually. In order to ensure effective programmemanagement, it is necessary to lay down common rules for interim paymentrequests, the payment of the annual balance, where appropriate, and the finalbalance, without prejudice to specific rules that are required for each of theCSF Funds.

(47)          The pre-financing payment atthe start of programmes ensures that the Member State has the means to providesupport to beneficiaries in the implementation of the programme from programmeadoption. Therefore, provisions should be made for initial pre-financingamounts from the CSF Funds. Initial pre-financing should be totally cleared atclosure of the programme.

(48)          In order to safeguard theUnion's financial interests, there should be measures limited in time thatallow the authorising officer by delegation to interrupt payments where thereis evidence to suggest a significant deficiency in the functioning of themanagement and control system, evidence of irregularities linked to a paymentapplication, or a failure to submit documents for the purpose of clearance ofaccounts.

(49)          In order to ensure that expenditure co-financedby the Union budget in any given financial year is used in accordance with theapplicable rules, an appropriate framework should be created for the annualclearance of accounts. Under this framework, the accredited bodies shouldsubmit to the Commission, in respect of each programme, a managementdeclaration of assurance accompanied by the certified annual accounts, asummary report of controls and an independent audit opinion and control report.

(50)          In order to safeguard the Union budget, it maybe necessary for the Commission to make financial corrections. To ensure legalcertainty for the Member States, it is important to define the circumstancesunder which breaches of applicable Union or national law can lead to financialcorrections by the Commission. In order to ensure thatfinancial corrections which the Commission may impose on Member States arerelated to the protection of the EU's financial interests, they should beconfined to cases where the breach of Union or national law concerns directlyor indirectly the eligibility, regularity, management or control of operationsand the corresponding expenditure. To ensureproportionality it is important that the Commission considers the nature andthe gravity of the breach in deciding the amount of financial correction.

(51)          In order to encouragefinancial discipline, it is appropriate to define the arrangements fordecommitment of any part of the budget commitment in a programme, in particularwhere an amount may be excluded from decommitment, notably when delays inimplementation result from circumstances which are independent of the partyconcerned, abnormal or unforeseeable and whose consequences cannot be avoideddespite the diligence shown.

(52)          Additional general provisions are necessary inrelation to the specific functioning of the Funds. In particular, in order toincrease their added value, and to enhance their contribution to the prioritiesof the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, thefunctioning of these Funds should be simplified and concentrated on the goalsof 'Investment for growth and jobs' and 'European territorial cooperation'.

(53)          Additional provisions for the specificfunctioning of the EAFRD and the EMFF are set out in the relevantsector-specific legislation.

(54)          In order to promote the Treaty objectives ofeconomic, social and territorial cohesion, the 'Investment for growth and jobs'goal should support all regions. To provide balanced and gradual support andreflect the level of economic and social development, resources under that goalshould be allocated from the ERDF and the ESF among the less developed regions,the transition regions and the more developed regions according to their grossdomestic product (GDP) per capita in relation to the EU average. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of investment fromthe Structural Funds, regions whose GDP per capita for the 2007-2013 period wasless than 75% of the average of the EU-25 for the reference period but whoseGDP per capita has grown to more than 75% of the EU-27 average should receiveat least two thirds of their 2007-2013 allocation. MemberStates whose per capita gross national income (GNI) is less than 90 % of thatof the Union average should benefit under the 'Investment for growth and jobs'goal from the CF.

(55)          Objective criteria should befixed for designating eligible regions and areas for support from the Funds. Tothis end, the identification of the regions and areas at Union level should bebased on the common system of classification of the regions established byRegulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council of 26May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial unitsfor statistics (NUTS)[12].

(56)          In order to set out anappropriate financial framework, the Commission should establish, by means ofimplementing acts, the indicative annual breakdown of available commitmentappropriations using an objective and transparent method with a view totargeting the regions whose development is lagging behind, including thosereceiving transitional support.

(57)          It is necessary to fix the limits of thoseresources for investment for growth and jobs and to adopt objective criteriafor their allocation to regions and Member States. In order to encourage thenecessary acceleration of development of infrastructure in transport and energyas well as information and communication technologies across the Union, aConnecting Europe Facility should be created. The allocation of the annual appropriations from the Funds and the amountstransferred from the Cohesion Fund to the Connecting Europe Facility to a MemberState should be limited to a ceiling that would be fixed taking into accountthe capacity of that particular Member State to absorb these appropriations. Inaddition, in line with the headline target on poverty reduction, it isnecessary to reorient the scheme for food support for the most deprived personsto promote social inclusion and the harmonious development of the Union. Amechanism is envisaged which transfers resources to this instrument and ensuresthat these will be constituted from ESF allocations through an implicitcorresponding decrease of the minimum percentage of the Structural Funds to beallocated to the ESF in each country.

(58)          In order to strengthen the focus on results and achievement of the Europe 2020objectives and targets, five per cent of theresources for the 'Investment for growth and jobs' goal should be set aside asa performance reserve for each Fund, and category of region in each MemberState.

(59)          As regards the Funds and with a view to ensuringan appropriate allocation to each category of regions, resources should not betransferred between less developed, transition and more developed regionsexcept in duly justified circumstances linked to the delivery of one or morethematic objectives and for no more than 2 % of the total appropriation forthat category of region.

(60)          In order to ensure a genuine economic impact,support from the Funds should not replace public expenditure or equivalentstructural expenditure by Member States under the terms of this Regulation. Inaddition, so that the support from the Funds takes into account a broadereconomic context, the level of public expenditure should be determined withreference to the general macroeconomic conditions in which the financing takesplace based on the indicators provided in the Stability and ConvergenceProgrammes submitted annually by Member States in accordance with Regulation(EC) No. 1466/1997 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance ofbudgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[13]. Verification bythe Commission of the principle of additionality should concentrate on theMember States in which less developed and transition regions cover at least 15%of the population because of the scale of the financial resources allocated tothem.

(61)          It is necessary to lay down additionalprovisions concerning the programming, management, monitoring and control ofoperational programmes supported by the Funds. Operational programmes shouldset out priority axes corresponding to thematic objectives, elaborate aconsistent intervention logic to tackle the development needs identified, andset out the framework for performance assessment. They should also containother elements necessary to underpin the effective and efficient implementationof these Funds.

(62)          With a view to improvingcomplementarities and simplifying implementation, it should be possible tocombine support from the CF and the ERDF with support from the ESF in jointoperational programmes under the growth and jobs goal.

(63)          Major projects represent asubstantial share of Union spending and are frequently of strategic importancewith respect to the achievement of the Union strategy for smart, sustainableand inclusive growth. Therefore it is justified that operations of substantial sizecontinue to be subject to approval by the Commission under this regulation. Toensure clarity, it is appropriate to define the content of a major project forthis purpose. The Commission should also have the possibility to refuse supportfor a major project where the granting of such support is not justified.

(64)          In order to give MemberStates the option of implementing part of an operational programme using aresult-based approach, it is useful to provide for ajoint action plan comprising a set of actions to be carried out by abeneficiary to contribute to the objectives of the operational programme. Inorder to simplify and reinforce the result orientation of the Funds themanagement of the joint action plan should be exclusively based on jointlyagreed milestones, outputs and results as defined in the Commission decisionadopting the joint action plan. Control and audit of a joint action plan shouldalso be limited to the achievement of these milestones, outputs and results.Consequently, it is necessary to lay down rules on its preparation, content,adoption, financial management and control of joint action plans.

(65)                      Where an urbanor territorial development strategy requires an integrated approach because itinvolves investments under more than one priority axis of one or severaloperational programmes, action supported by the Funds should be carried out asan integrated territorial investment within an operational programme.

(66)          It is necessary to adopt specific rules inrelation to the functions of the monitoring committee and the annual reports onimplementation of operational programmes supported by the Funds. Additional provisions for the specific functioning of the EAFRD areset out in the relevant sector specific legislation.

(67)          To ensure the availabilityof essential and up to date information on programme implementation, it isnecessary that Member States provide the Commission with the key data on a regularbasis. In order to avoid an additional burden on Member States, this should belimited to data collected continuously, and the transmission should beperformed by way of electronic data exchange.

(68)          In accordance with Article 175 of the Treaty,the Commission submits Cohesion Reports to the European Parliament, theCouncil, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regionsevery three years on the progress made towards achieving the Union's economic,social and territorial cohesion. It is necessary to lay down the content ofthis report.

(69)          It is considered appropriate that theCommission, in cooperation with the Member States, carries out the ex postevaluation for the Funds to obtain information at the appropriate level on theresults and impact of interventions financed. Specific provisions are alsoneeded to establish a procedure for the approval of the evaluation plans forthe Funds.

(70)          It is important to bring the achievements of theUnion's Funds to the attention of the general public. Citizens have the rightto know how the Union's financial resources are invested. The responsibility toensure that the appropriate information is communicated to the public shouldlie with both the managing authorities and the beneficiaries. To ensure more efficiency in communication to the public at largeand stronger synergies between the communication activities undertaken at theinitiative of the Commission, the budget allocated to communication actionsunder this Regulation shall also contribute to cover corporate communication ofthe political priorities of the European Union provided that these are relatedto the general objectives of this Regulation.

(71)          For the purpose of ensuring a wide disseminationof information about the achievements of the Funds and the role of the Uniontherein and to inform potential beneficiaries about funding opportunities,detailed rules about information and communication measures, as well as certaintechnical characteristics of such measures, should be defined in thisRegulation.

(72)          With a view to strengthening accessibility andtransparency of information about funding opportunities and projectbeneficiaries, in each Member State a single website or website portalproviding information on all the operational programmes, including the lists ofoperations supported under each operational programme, should be madeavailable.

(73)          It is necessary to determine the elements formodulating the co-financing rate from the Funds to operational programmes, inparticular, to increase the multiplier effect of Union resources. It is also necessaryto establish the maximum rates of co-financing by category of region in order toensure respect of the principle of co-financing through an appropriate level ofnational support.

(74)          It is necessary for MemberStates to designate a managing authority, a certifying authority and afunctionally independent auditing authority for each operational programme. To provideflexibility for Member States in the set up of control systems, it isappropriate to provide the option for the functions of the certifying authorityto be carried out by the managing authority. The Member State should also beallowed to designate intermediate bodies to carry out certain tasks of themanaging authority or the certifying authority. The Member State should in thatcase lay down clearly their respective responsibilities and functions.

(75)          The managing authority bearsthe main responsibility for the effective and efficient implementation of theFunds and thus fulfils a substantial number of functions related to programmemanagement and monitoring, financial management and controls as well as projectselection. Its responsibilities and functions should be set out.

(76)          The certifying authority should draw up andsubmit to the Commission payment applications. It should draw up the annualaccounts, certifying the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the annualaccounts and that the expenditure entered in the accounts complies withapplicable Union and national rules. Itsresponsibilities and functions should be set out.

(77)          The audit authority should ensure that auditsare carried out on the management and control systems, on an appropriate sampleof operations and on the annual accounts.Its responsibilities and functions should be set out.

(78)          In order to take account of the specificorganisation of the management and control systems for the ERDF, ESF and CohesionFunds and the need to ensure a proportionate approach, specific provisions arerequired for the accreditation and withdrawal of accreditation of the managingauthority and the certifying authority.

(79)          Without prejudice to theCommission's powers as regards financial control, cooperation between theMember States and the Commission in this field should be increased and criteriashould be established which allow the Commission to determine, in the contextof its strategy of control of national systems, the level of assurance itshould obtain from national audit bodies.

(80)          In addition to common ruleson financial management, additional provisions are necessary for the ERDF, ESFand the Cohesion Fund. In particular, with a view to ensuring reasonableassurance for the Commission prior to the annual clearance of accounts,applications for interim payments should be reimbursed at a rate of 90 % of theamount resulting from applying the co-financing rate for each priority axis aslaid down in the decision adopting the operational programme to the eligibleexpenditure for the priority axis. The outstanding amounts due should be paidto the Member States upon annual clearance of accounts, provided thatreasonable assurance has been attained in regard to the eligibility ofexpenditure for the year covered by the clearance procedure.

(81)          To ensure that beneficiariesreceive the support as soon as possible and to reinforce the assurance for theCommission it is appropriate to require that payment applications include onlyexpenditure for which the support has been paid to beneficiaries. Pre-financingeach year should be foreseen to ensure that Member State have sufficient meansto operate under such arrangements. Such pre-financing should be cleared eachyear with the clearance of accounts.

(82)          To ensure the appropriateapplication of the general rules on decommitment, the rules established for theFunds should detail how the deadlines for decommitment are established and howthe respective amounts are calculated.

(83)          It is necessary to specifythe detailed procedure for the annual clearance of accounts applicable to theFunds to ensure a clear basis and legal certainty for these arrangements. It isimportant to envisage a limited possibility for the Member State to define aprovision in its annual accounts for an amount, which is subject to an ongoingprocedure with the audit authority.

(84)          The process of annualclearance of accounts should be accompanied by an annual closure of completedoperations (for the ERDF and the CF) or expenditure (for the ESF). In order toreduce the costs associated with the final closure of operational programmes, toreduce the administrative burden for beneficiaries and to provide legalcertainty, annual closure should be obligatory thereby limiting the periodduring which the supporting documents need to be maintained and during whichoperations can be audited and financial corrections imposed.

(85)          In order to safeguardthe Union's financial interests and provide the means to ensure effectiveprogramme implementation, there should be measures allowing for the suspensionby the Commission of payments at the level of priority axis or operationalprogramme.

(86)          It is appropriate to laydown the specific arrangements and procedures for financial corrections byMember States and by the Commission in respect of the Funds to provide legalcertainty for Member States.

(87)          The frequency of audits onoperations should be proportionate to the extent of the Union's support fromthe Funds. In particular, the number of audits s carried out should be reducedwhere the total eligible expenditure for an operation does not exceed EUR 100000. Nevertheless, it should be possible to carry out audits at any time wherethere is evidence of an irregularity or fraud, or, following closure of a completedoperation, as part of an audit sample. In order that the level of auditing bythe Commission is proportionate to the risk, the Commission should be able toreduce its audit work in relation to operational programmes where there are nosignificant deficiencies or where the audit authority can be relied on.

(88)          In order to supplement and amend certainnon-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should bedelegated to the Commission in respect of a code of conduct on the objectivesand criteria to support the implementation of partnership, the adoption of aCommon Strategic Framework, additional rules on the allocation of the growthand competitiveness reserve, the definition of the area and population coveredby the local development strategies, detailed rules on financial instruments (exante assessment, eligibility of expenses, types of activities notsupported, combination of support, transfer and management of assets, paymentrequests, and capitalisation of annual instalments), the definition of the flatrate for revenue generating operations, the responsibilities of MemberStates concerning the procedure for reporting irregularities and recovery ofsums unduly paid, the model of management declaration of assurance on thefunctioning of the management and control system, the conditions of nationalaudits, the accreditation criteria for managing authorities and certifyingauthorities, the identification of commonly accepted data carriers, the levelof financial correction to be applied, the amendment of annexes and thespecific measures necessary for the facilitation of transition from Regulation(EC) No 1083/2006. The Commission should also be empowered to amend Annexes Iand IV in order to address future adaptation needs. It is of particularimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during itspreparatory work, including at expert level.

Theright to act is constituted by Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union, whichstates that "[the Union] shall promote economic, social and territorialcohesion and solidarity among Member States", as well as by Article 175 ofthe TFEU which explicitly requests the Union to implement this policy by meansof Structural Funds, and Article 177 which defines the role of the CohesionFund. The aims of European Social Fund (ESF), European Regional DevelopmentFund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund (CF) are defined in Articles 162, 176 and 177.More details on the added value of EU involvement can be found in the relatedImpact Assessment.

As the EU Budget Review has highlighted, the"EU budget should be used to finance EU public goods, actions that MemberStates and regions cannot finance themselves, or where it can secure betterresults".[76] The legal proposal willrespect the principle of subsidiarity as the tasks of the Funds are set out inthe Treaty and the policy is implemented in accordance with the principle ofshared management and respecting the institutional competencies of MemberStates and regions.

1.5.3.          Lessons learned from similar experiences in thepast

A summary can be found in the Impact Assessment accompanying theproposal.

1.5.4.          Coherence and possible synergy with otherrelevant instruments

A Common Strategic Framework will be established. This willtranslate the objectives and priorities of Europe 2020 into investmentpriorities for the ERDF, CF, ESF, EAFRD and the EMFF which will ensure an integrateduse of the funds to deliver common objectives. The common strategic frameworkwill also set out coordination mechanisms with other relevant Union policiesand instruments.

2.                      MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1.                Monitoring and reporting rules

Specify frequencyand conditions.

The monitoring system will be based on a system of sharedmanagement. Monitoring Committees set up for each operational programme andannual implementation reports for each operational programme will be at theheart of the approach. Monitoring Committees will meet at least once per year.Annual review meetings between the Commission and Member States complement thesystem.

In addition to the implementation reports for each operationalprogramme progress reports in 2017 and 2019 will focus on strategic issues atMember State level. Based on this, the Commission will prepare strategicreports in 2017 and 2019.

The monitoring and reporting system will be based on output andresult indicators. The proposals set out a set of common indicators that willbe used for the aggregation of information at an EU level. At key points of theimplementation period (2017 and 2019), additional analytical requirements on theprogress of programmes are part of the annual implementation reports. Themonitoring and reporting system fully uses the potential of electronic datatransfers.

Evaluation arrangements shall be put in place to evaluate theeffectiveness, efficiency and the impact of the policy, especially with regardto the EU2020 headline targets and other relevant impact indicators.

2.2.                Management and control system 2.2.1.          Risk(s) identified

Since 2007 the European Court of Auditors ('the Court') has reportedin its annual report an estimated error rate for Cohesion Policy as a whole foreach budget year (2006-2009) based on an independent, annual, random sample oftransactions.

The Court's estimated level of error for Cohesion Policy has beenhigh compared to other policy groups of the EU budget in these years, and hasvaried around 5%-10% of expenditure for the current programming period. Howeverthe error rate provided by the Court applies to interim payments submitted byMember States which are reimbursed by the Commission before all controlsforeseen for 2007-2013 programmes have been carried out at national andCommunity level.

Under current rules, interim payments are certified by theCertifying Authority to the Commission after management desk checks on allexpenditure claimed by beneficiaries have been carried out, but frequentlybefore on the spot in-depth management checks or subsequent audit activities.Therefore the multiannual financing arrangements mean that controls are carriedout before but also after the audit work is done by the European Court ofAuditors, and the residual error after all controls have been completed can besignificantly lower that the error rate detected by the Court. On the basis ofpast experience, the residual error at the end of the programming once allcontrols have been completed is estimated to be in the range of 2-5%.

A number of measures have been foreseen in the proposals to reducethe error rate linked to the interim payments made by Commission (the errorrate reported by the European Court of Auditors):

1) Interim payments by the Commission will be capped at 90% ofthe amount due to Member States, as at this point only part of the nationalcontrols have been carried out. The remaining balance will be paidfollowing the annual clearance of accounts once audit evidence and reasonableassurance has been provided by the managing authority and the audit authority.Any irregularities detected by the Commission or the European Court of Auditorsafter the transmission of annual certified accounts by the managing/certifyingauthority will lead to a net correction. This will provide greater incentivesto Member States to ensure the regularity of expenditure certified to theCommission compared to the present approach which allows for more extensiverecycling of recovered funds throughout the lifetime of programmes.

2) Introduction of an annual clearance of accounts and of anannual closure of completed operations or expenditure, which will createadditional incentives for national and regional authorities to undertakequality controls in a timely manner in view of the annual certification ofaccounts to the Commission. This constitutes a reinforcement of presentfinancial management arrangements and offers better assurance that irregularexpenditure is excluded from the accounts on annual basis rather than at theend of the programming period.

It is expected that the measures outlined above (the newreimbursement system, annual clearance and closure and definitive netcorrections by the Commission) will reduce the error rate below 5%, and thatthe final residual error rate at closure of programmes will be closer to the 2%materiality threshold applied by the European Court of Auditors.

This estimation is nevertheless subject to the capacity of the Commissionand Member States to address the principal risks outlined below.

An analysis of errors reported by the Court and the Commission inthe last five years shows that the principal errors found are concentratedin a limited number of programmes in some Member States. The error ratesbased on statistical samples reported by audit authorities also demonstratesubstantial variation between different programmes and thus support thisanalysis. The proposal to focus audit activities and resources to high riskprogrammes, and to allow proportionate control measures for programmes witheffective control systems, would address the principal risks in a moreeffective manner and lead to a more efficient use of existing audit resourcesboth at national and Commission level. The possibility to benefit fromproportionate arrangements in relation to the situation of each programme canin itself introduce incentives for more effective control measures.

The analysis of errors that have remained undetected by the nationalmanagement and control systems and thus have been identified by the Court inits 2006-2009 audits also shows a concentration of risks in the followingcategories:

For ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, publicprocurement errors have contributed approximately to 41% of the cumulativequantifiable errors found. Errors related to eligibility accounted for39% and included various types of errors such as errors in projectselection, funding of ineligible categories of costs, costs falling outside theeligibility period or eligible area, miscalculation of co-financing rates,financing of ineligible VAT etc. Weaknesses in the audit trail accountedfor 11% of quantifiable errors (with the proportion decreasing over time due toreinforced management controls), and errors linked to the complex issue of revenuegenerating projects (revenues not deducted or calculated incorrectly andthus the co-financing rate was too high) accounted for 6% of quantifiableerrors reported over the period.

For the ESF, eligibility issues havecontributed approximately to 58% of the cumulative quantifiable errors foundand encompassed in particular non-eligible participants, non-eligibledirect and indirect costs, payments after or before the eligibilityperiod, ineligible expenditure declared on a flat-rate basis, ineligible costsof scholarship and public allowances, revenues not deducted when calculatingeligible expenditure or calculated incorrectly, services paid but not deliveredand ineligible VAT. Accuracy issues, that represented 7% of quantifiableerrors reported, concerned incorrect allocation of direct and indirectcosts, unduly justified overhead allocation method, mistakes incalculation of expenses, non-respect of the real cost principle,over-declaration of costs, incorrect calculation of co-financing rates andfinally multiple declaration of staff costs. Audit trail issues contributedto 35% of errors and referred to the absence of essential supporting documents,in particular at the level of beneficiaries.

Although the Commission is undertaking a number of actions with theMember States to reduce these errors, it is anticipated that, pending adoptionof the current proposal and their proper implementation in the Member States,these errors could remain potential risk areas in the next programming period2014-2020.

Errors related to public procurement in particular are a majorsource of errors that may be estimated to an error rate of approximately 2%-4%each year on average for the current programming period. Proposals put forwardunder Cohesion Policy will ensure more effective controls, however to achieve asubstantial reduction in the error rate under Cohesion Policy, it is importantthat these actions are complemented by a clarification and simplification ofpublic procurement rules. In the absence of streamlined public procurementprocedures, and if public administrations and beneficiaries in the MemberStates are unable to improve the implementation of these rules, Cohesion Policywould continue to be systematically affected by this part of the current errorrate. The current revision of the Directive on public procurement shouldtherefore provide an opportunity to contribute to a reduction of errors inCohesion Policy along the lines indicated above.

2.2.2.          Control method(s) envisaged

The proposed architecture of the management and control systemsrepresents an evolution of the set-up in place in 2007-2013 and preserves mostof the functions carried out in the current period including administrative andon-the spot verifications, audits of management and control systems and auditsof operations. It also maintains the role of the Commission, along with thepossibility for interruptions, suspensions and financial corrections by theCommission.

In order to reinforce accountability, programme authorities would beaccredited by a national accrediting body in charge of their ongoingsupervision. The proposal offers the flexibility to keep the currentarchitecture of three key authorities by programme in cases where the currentsystem has been proven to be effective. However it also offers the possibilityto merge the managing and certifying authority and thus decrease the number ofinvolved authorities in the Member States. A smaller number of bodies in placewould reduce the administrative burden and enhance the possibility for buildingstronger administrative capacity, but also permit a clearer distribution ofresponsibilities.

The costs of tasks related to control (at national and regionallevel, excluding the costs of the Commission) are estimated around 2% of thetotal funding administered in the period 2007-2013[79].These costs are related to the following areas of control: 1% is derived fromnational coordination and programme preparation, 82% relate to programmemanagement, 4% to certification and 13% to audit.

The following proposals will increase the costs of control:

-the creation and functioning of an accrediting body (the costs ofwhich may be offset by the merger of the managing and certifying authorities,if this option is selected by the Member State);

- the submission of certified annual accounts and an annualmanagement declaration, which implies having carried out all necessary controlswithin the accounting year (which may require additional administrativeeffort);

- the need for additional audit activity by the audit authorities toaudit the management declaration or the need to finish its audits and expressan audit opinion in a shorter period of time compared to the currentobligations.

There are however also proposals which will reduce the costs ofcontrol:

- the option to merge the managing and certifying authorities, whichcould allow the Member State to save a substantial part of the 4% of thecurrent costs relating to certification due to better administrative efficiency,reduced need for coordination and reduction of the scope of audits;

-the use of simplified costs and Joint Action Plans, which reducesadministrative costs and burdens at all levels, for both administrations andbeneficiaries;

-proportionate control arrangements for management verifications andfor audits;

-annual closure, which will reduce the cost of retention ofdocuments for control purposes for public administrations and beneficiaries.

Therefore overall it is expected that proposals will lead to a redistributionof control costs (remaining around 2% of the total funding managed), ratherthan an increase or a reduction. It is howeveranticipated that this redistribution of costs (across functions and due to theproportionate control arrangements, also across Member States and programmes)will enable more effective mitigation of risks and thus will lead to an errorrate below 5%.

In addition to changes in the financial management and controlarrangement which contribute to the effective detection and early exclusion oferrors from the accounts, the proposal foresees simplification in several areasthat contributes to the prevention of errors. Asindicated above, measures proposed in these areas would address 55% of theerror rates reported for the current period.

These measures include:

- A more extensive use of simplified costs which reduces errorsrelated to financial management, eligibility rules and audit trail, andreorients both implementation and control towards the performance ofoperations.

- A greater thematic concentration of funding, which can entail areduction of errors stemming from the wide variety of interventions and thus avariety of eligibility rules applied.

- Clarified rules for the selection of projects.

- A simpler, flat rate based, approach to revenue-generatingoperations which will reduce the risk of errors in determining and deductingthe revenue generated by operations.

- Harmonisation, clarification and simplification of eligibilityrules with other EU financial support instruments which will reduce mistakesmade by beneficiaries who use assistance from different sources.

- A mandatory setup of electronic data management and electronicdata exchange between the administration and beneficiaries which has thepotential to curtail the error rate arising from inadequate document retentionand simplifying the administrative burden on beneficiaries.

- Annual closure of operations or expenditure, which decreases audittrail errors by shortening the time period for document retention and avoidsthe substantial build-up of administrative workload linked to the one-offclosure at the end of the programming period.

Most of the simplifications listed above also contribute to thereduction of administrative burden for beneficiaries and thus represent a simultaneousreduction of risks of error and of administrative burden.

2.3.                Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities

Specify existing orenvisaged prevention and protection measures.

The Structural Funds services together with OLAF have put in place aJoint Fraud Prevention Strategy which foresees a series of actions to becarried out by the Commission and the Member States to prevent fraud instructural actions under shared management.

Both DGs are currently developing a fraud risk scoring model whichwill be used by the concerned managing authorities on 116 ESF and 60 ERDFprogrammes.

The recent Commission Communication on an anti-fraud strategy(COM(2011)376 final of 24.6.2011) welcomes the existing strategy as a bestpractice initiative and envisages complementary actions to it, the mostimportant being that the Commission proposal for 2014-2020 regulations requestMember States to put in place fraud prevention measures which are effective andproportionate to the identified fraud risks.

The current Commission proposal includes an explicit requirement toput in place such measures under Article 86(4)(c). This should reinforce fraudawareness in Member States among all bodies involved in the management andcontrol of funds and thus reduce the risk of fraud.
