2012/0085 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

on imports of rice originating inBangladesh

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission[2],

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)       In the context of theUruguay round, the Union has undertaken to offer preferential importarrangements for rice originating in the least–developed countries. One of thecountries to which the offer was addressed, Bangladesh, indicated its interestin the development of trade in rice. To that end, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3491/90of 26 November 1990 on imports of rice originating in Bangladesh[3] has been adopted.

(2)       Regulation (EEC) No3491/90 confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of itsprovisions. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, thosepowers need to be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union (the Treaty). For the sake of clarity it isappropriate to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 3491/90 and to replace it with a newRegulation.

(3)       In order to ensure thereliability and the efficiency of the preferential import arrangement, thepower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should bedelegated to the Commission to establish rules making the participation in thearrangement conditional upon the lodging of a security. It is of particularimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during itspreparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing anddrawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriatetransmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to theCouncil.

(4)       In order to ensure uniformconditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powersshould be conferred on the Commission. Those powers, save where explicitlyprovided otherwise, should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 February 2011 layingdown the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control byMember states of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers[4]. However, where the suspensionof the preferential import arrangement becomes necessary, the Commission shouldbe allowed to adopt implementing acts without applying the Regulation (EU) No182/2011.

(5)       The preferential importarrangements involve a reduction of the import duty within the limits of acertain quantity of husked rice. The equivalent quantities at stages of millingother than that of husked rice should be calculated in accordance with CommissionRegulation (EC) No 1312/2008 of 19 December 2008 fixing the conversion rates,the processing costs and the value of the by-products for the various stages ofrice processing[5].

(6)       In order to fix the importduties applicable to rice originating in Bangladeshimported under this Regulation, account should be taken of the relevantprovisions of Regulation No XXXX/XXXX of the EuropeanParliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation ofagricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agriculturalproducts (Single CMO Regulation)[6].

(7)       To ensure that theadvantages of the preferential import arrangements are limited only to riceoriginating in Bangladesh, a certificate of origin should be issued and an exporttax of an amount corresponding to the reduction of the import duty should becollected by the exporting country,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
