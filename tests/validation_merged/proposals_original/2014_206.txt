Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (codification) /* COM/2014/0443 final - 2014/0206 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           In the context of a people’sEurope, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifyingthe law of the Union so as to make it clearer and more accessible to citizens,thus giving them new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specificrights it gives them.

This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerousprovisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially,remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrumentand partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing manydifferent instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.

For this reason a codification of rules thathave frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear andtransparent.

2.           On 1 April 1987 theCommission decided[1]to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no morethan ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and thatdepartments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts forwhich they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear andreadily understandable.

3.           The Conclusions of the Presidencyof the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing theimportance of codification as it offers certainty as to the lawapplicable to a given matter at a given time.

Codification must be undertaken in fullcompliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.

Given that no changes of substance may be madeto the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament,the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreementdated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used forthe fast-track adoption of codification instruments.

4.           The purpose of this proposal isto undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 of 16 June 2008 on certain procedures forapplying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communitiesand their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of theother part, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-relatedmatters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia andHerzegovina, of the other part[3]. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated init[4]; this proposal fullypreserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more thanbring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by thecodification exercise itself.

5.           The codification proposal was drawn up on thebasis of a preliminary consolidation, in 22 official languages, of Regulation (EC)No 594/2008 and the instrument amending it, carried out by the PublicationsOffice of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system.Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the oldand the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex II to thecodified Regulation.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

on certain procedures for applying theStabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities andtheir Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the otherpart, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related mattersbetween the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, ofthe other part (codification)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty Ö on theFunctioning of the European Union Õ , and inparticular Article Ö 207(2) Õ thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

ê

(1)       CouncilRegulation (EC) No 594/2008[6]has been substantially amended[7]. In the interests ofclarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.

ê Corrigendum, OJL 233, 30.8.2008, p. 1 (adapted)

(2)       AStabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities andtheir Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the otherpart (‘SAA’), was signed in Luxembourg on 16 June 2008.

(3)       On16 June 2008 the Council concluded an InterimAgreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, ofthe one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part[8] (‘Interim Agreement’) which Ö provided Õ for the earlyentry into force of the trade and trade-related provisions of the SAA. TheInterim Agreement Ö entered Õ into force on Ö 1 July2008 Õ .

(4)       Itis necessary to lay down the procedures for applying certain provisions of theInterim Agreement. Since the trade and trade-related provisions of Ö those Õ instruments are to a very large extent identical, this Regulationshould also apply to the implementation of the SAA after its entry into force.

(5)       TheSAA and the Interim Agreement stipulate that fishery products originating inBosnia and Herzegovina may be imported into the Ö Union Õ at a reducedcustoms duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary tolay down provisions regulating the management of Ö those Õ tariff quotas.

(6)       Wheretrade defence measures become necessary, they should be adopted in accordancewith the general provisions laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No  260/2009[9],Council Regulation (EC) No  1061/2009[10], Council Regulation (EC) No  1225/2009[11] or, as the case may be, Council Regulation (EC) No  597/2009[12].

(7)       Wherea Member State provides the Commission with information on a possible fraud orfailure to provide administrative cooperation, the relevant Ö Union Õ legislationshall apply, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97[13].

(8)       Forthe purposes of implementing the relevant provisions of this Regulation theCommission should be assisted by the Customs Code Committee established by Article 285 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[14].

ê 37/2014Art. 1 and Annex .17 (adapted)

(9)        The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the InterimAgreement and of the Ö SAA Õ requiresuniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard and other measures. Thosemeasures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[15].

(10)     TheCommission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in dulyjustified cases relating to exceptional and critical circumstances arisingwithin the meaning of Article 24(5)(b) and Article 25(4) of the Interim Agreement, and thereafter Article 39(5)(b) and Article 40(4) of the Ö SAA Õ, imperativegrounds of urgency so require,
