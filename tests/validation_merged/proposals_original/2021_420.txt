CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

•

Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

This legislative proposal for the revision of Regulation (EU) 1315/2013 – Union guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) is a key action of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. The aim of the TEN-T Regulation is to build an effective EU-wide and multimodal network of rail, inland waterways, short sea shipping routes and roads which are linked to urban nodes, maritime and inland ports, airports and terminals across the EU. The problems addressed by the revision are insufficient and/or incomplete TEN-T infrastructure standards and a lack of integration of standards for alternative fuels infrastructure on the TEN-T with negative impacts on climate and environment. Secondly, the TEN-T network suffers from capacity bottlenecks and an insufficient network connectivity to all regions that hamper multimodality. Thirdly, the insufficient safety and reliability of the TEN-T infrastructure needs to be addressed. Finally, the governance instruments are inadequate compared to new needs and the TEN-T network design needs a review to increase coherence with other policies.

The TEN-T revision thus aims at reaching four main objectives. Firstly, it aims at making transport greener by providing the appropriate infrastructure basis to alleviate congestion and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and pollution of air and water by making each mode of transport more efficient and by enabling increased transport activity by more sustainable forms of transport. It aims in particular to facilitate an increase in the share of rail, short sea shipping and inland waterways in view of a more sustainable modal composition of the transport system and consequently to reduce its negative externalities. Secondly, it aims at facilitating seamless and efficient transport, fostering multimodality and interoperability between the TEN-T transport modes and better integrating the urban nodes into the network. Removing bottlenecks and missing links, and improving multimodality and interoperability in the European transport system will contribute to the completion of the internal market.

Thirdly, it strives to increase the resilience of TEN-T to climate change and other natural hazards or human-made disasters. TEN-T must be resilient to the potential adverse impacts of climate change in order to protect public investments and safeguard their continued usability in the new climate; and they should support climate-neutrality by integrating the costs of greenhouse gas emissions in the cost-benefit analysis. Last but not least, it points at improving the efficiency of the TEN-T governance tools, at streamlining the reporting and monitoring instruments and at reviewing the TEN-T network design.

With this revised TEN-T policy we should seek to build a reliable, seamless and high quality trans-European transport network which ensures sustainable connectivity throughout the European Union without physical gaps, bottlenecks or missing links by 2050. This network will contribute to the good functioning of the internal market, to the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU territory and to the European Green Deal objectives. It should be gradually developed in steps, with intermediate deadlines in 2030 and 2040.

This initiative is part of the Commission Work Programme 2021 under Annex I (new initiatives).

•

Consistency with existing policy provisions in the

policy area

As the main pillar of EU transport infrastructure policy, the TEN-T Regulation acts as enabler and also depends on complementary policies. The standards and requirements set in the TEN-T Regulation are directly connected with the relevant objectives and needs in other transport sectors/fields and thus with other more sector-specific legislations. This means, for example, that the TEN-T rail infrastructure – for ensuring seamless cross-border transport and mobility – has to comply with interoperability legislation set in railway policy. Similarly, TEN-T road infrastructure has to take up and comply with EU legislation on road safety. The implementation of sectoral policies also needs a strong TEN-T Regulation framework since the TEN-T provides the infrastructure network for the implementation of other sectoral measures or other pieces of legislation, some of which however go beyond the TEN-T.

The TEN-T Regulation performance on indicators such as those related to modal shares, better service quality, the uptake of recharging/refuelling infrastructure depends on coordinated efforts with related policy fields. This particularly relates to the synergies between TEN-T and the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (AFIR proposal) as well as TEN-T and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), since both are intrinsically dependent on each other. For instance, the AFIR regulates the provision of charging/fuelling points on the TEN-T whilst the TEN-T Regulation provides the infrastructure basis for their wide deployment in a European network perspective. Similarly, the ITS regulates the provision of intelligent transport systems on the TEN-T, as part of a broader package of measures. Both AFIR and ITS need a definition of the TEN-T for their implementation (i.e. a geographical scope of application), which is provided by the maps contained in the TEN-T Regulation. These considerations also apply to other initiatives which are part of the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy action plan, such as the revision of the Rail Freight Corridor Regulation, the revision of the urban mobility package, or the NAIADES III Action Plan. The TEN-T Regulation will define the alignment of the European Transport Corridors that shall replace the Rail Freight Corridors and Core Network Corridors. This will ensure coherence in the network development and will contribute to build synergies between the infrastructure and operational aspects of the network.

•

Consistency with other Union policies

The European Green Deal, adopted by the European Commission in December 2019, puts climate action at its core, by setting an EU climate neutrality objective by 2050. In the domain of transport, the European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transport in order for the EU to become a climate-neutral economy by 2050, while working towards the zero-pollution ambition.

Furthermore

,

the

TEN-T is closely linked to the

t

rans-European

n

etworks policies in the fields of

e

nergy and

t

elecom

munication

s and provisions to exploit synergies between the three policies are enshrined in the legislation.

Similarly, the TEN-T is also closely linked to maritime policy, i.e. with maritime transport

being

one of the key

sustainable

blue economy sectors

.

In terms of EU funding and financing, the TEN-T Regulation is directly linked to the Regulation of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) as it defines the projects of common interest that are eligible under CEF. In addition, the TEN-T infrastructure is largely funded by the European Structural and Investment Fund

s

(ESIF) and since recently also through the Recovery and Resilience Fund (RRF). Finally

,

TEN-T is fully aligned with EU environmental

and climate

policies such as the Biodiversity

and legislation, including

and the Birds and Habitats Directives

and

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

•

Legal basis

The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (Articles 170-172) stipulates the establishment and development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastruct

ures

.

The Union shall aim at promoting the interconnection and interoperability of national networks as well as access to such networks. It shall take account in particular of the need to link islands, landlocked and peripheral with the central regions of the Union (Article 170 TFEU). For this purpose, the Union shall establish a series of guidelines covering the objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures envisaged in the sphere of trans-European networks. These guidelines shall identify projects of common interest, shall implement any measures that may prove necessary to ensure the interoperability of the networks, in particular in the field of technical standardisation and may support projects of common interest supported by Member States. Furthermore, the Union may also contribute, through the Cohesion Fund set up pursuant to Article 177, to the financing of specific projects in Member States in the area of transport infrastructure. To ensure interoperability of networks cooperation with third countries is equally foreseen (Article 171 TFEU).

•

Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)

The TFEU defines that the trans-European networks shall enable citizens of the Union, economic operators and regional communities to derive full benefit from an area without internal frontiers. They shall also take account of the need to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union and to promote its overall harmonious development.

TEN-T policy is thereby, by its nature, a policy that extends beyond Member States borders since it focusses on a single European network scheme across borders. Such European wide network can obviously not be established by one Member State alone. If Member States developed infrastructure purely on their own, national interests would often outweigh the European interest. As such, the benefits of a European sustainable and high quality transport network would be foregone. In this case, it would be likely that issues of cross-border connectivity and interoperability would also not be sufficiently addressed since intra-national connections are mostly prioritised by Member States even if cross-border projects are essential to exploit the benefits of the entire network and to remove bottlenecks which generate congestion. This would not only lead to the risk of a lack of seamless travel connectivity across Europe, but also lead to possible incoherence of national planning approaches. In return, different standards and interoperability requirements in different EU Member States would hamper the seamless transport flows throughout the EU and even increase costs for transport users. Overall, a seamless TEN-T without physical gaps, integrating intelligent and innovative solutions is key to facilitating the internal market, increasing cohesion and contributing to the objectives of the European Green Deal.

Since its establishment as an EU policy in 1993, the added value of TEN-T policy overall has always been strongly affirmed by Member States, regions, cities and industrial stakeholders. The EU added value of TEN-T has also been one of the main conclusions of the evaluation of the current TEN-T Regulation. Indeed, concentrating efforts towards the creation of a common, Europe-wide transport network is clearly acknowledged as a vision whose benefits go beyond isolated national action. Ensuring a common and coherent EU-wide basis for the identification of ‘projects of common interest’ and, correspondingly, for the alignment of planning and implementation efforts of a wide range of actors is a clear and widely recognised added value of TEN-T.

This also applies to the dimension of urban nodes as it is important that urban traffic is well connected with interregional and international traffic. Indeed, the role of urban nodes on the TEN-T goes beyond the local level, as transport activities on the TEN-T start and/or end in such nodes, or transit them, requiring good coordination between the different levels in order to avoid bottlenecks.

However, urban mobility is and shall remain a policy mainly under the remit of the Member States (local authorities). EU action should remain limited to aspects of urban mobility which are connected with interregional and international traffic. This also accounts for the maintenance of infrastructure: while maintaining infrastructure is and will remain the main responsibility of Member States, it is essential to guarantee through minimum rules in the TEN-T Regulation that the TEN-T will continue to provide a high quality of services to citizens and businesses.

•

Proportionality

As detailed in chapter 7 of the Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal none of the policy options goes beyond what is necessary to reach the overall policy objectives. The proposed intervention incentivises a shift of transport volumes to more sustainable modes of transport necessary to deliver on the increased climate ambition for 2030 and the overall objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050. The Policy Options are designed to create a coherent policy framework and a coherent, high standard transport network as the basis for other sectoral policies to deliver on their objectives. They are designed to avoid disproportionate impacts on public authorities, operators of infrastructure and mobility service providers, notably by building on and further developing a well-established governance system. This has been fully demonstrated in the evaluation of Regulation (EU) 1315/2013 and the baseline analysis underpinning the impact assessment for the revision of that Regulation. Thus, they fully respect the principle of proportionality.

•

Choice of the instrument

Since this is a proposal for revising an existing Regulation it seems legitimate to keep the status of the instrument as it is.

RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

•

Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks

of existing legislation

The evaluation of the TEN-T Regulation (SWD(2021)117final)

concluded that the TEN-T provides all relevant actors (i.e. Member States, regions, cities, transport industry, infrastructure managers of all transport modes, users) with a common policy framework which works towards the gradual completion of the common and consistent European transport infrastructure network. As such, it adds a European perspective to national infrastructure planning and addresses needs and benefits beyond single national approaches. However, the evaluation also concluded that efforts need to be stepped up in order to reach new political targets. Indeed, since the establishment of the TEN-T Regulation in 2013 the policy context has changed significantly, particularly through the adoption of the

European Green Deal

and the S

ustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy

as well as the Zero Pollution Action Plan.

Main conclusions of the ex-post evaluation

Proposal

Conclusions on relevance

All four specific objectives of the TEN-T Regulation remain relevant, are equally important and complementary to each other.

The proposal maintains and develops the specific objectives of the Regulation further

The design structure as well as the completion deadlines of 2030 and 2050 have proven their appropriateness.

The proposal broadly maintains the network structure and the completion deadlines but adds a new intermediate deadline (2040) to ensure a stepwise approach toward 2050.

For the specific objectives “efficiency of infrastructure development to facilitate the internal market” and “social, economic and territorial cohesion”, there is a strong need to advance on requirements enhancing the quality of the TEN-T infrastructure.

The proposal aims to increase the quality of the TEN-T and ensure that this quality is preserved over the lifetime of the infrastructure. Further measures are introduced to advance on interoperability and accessibility of the network.

For the specific objective “sustainability”, the lack of appropriateness to enable decarbonisation in line with the objective of the European Green Deal needs to be overcome. The reduction of transport emissions by 90% by 2050 cannot be achieved without a proper TEN-T allowing for greener transport.

The proposal reinforces the requirements in line with the needed contribution to the objectives of the European Green Deal for all transport modes.

For the specific objective “increasing user benefits”, the TEN-T Regulation should be advanced to strengthen the identification, combination and implementation of projects from the perspective of integrated door-to-door user services. This current lack of appropriateness seems to be particularly evident in the passengers’ sector.

In the proposal, measures are defined to strengthen the service and user perspective of the TEN-T especially in relation to passenger transport.

Complementarity between core and comprehensive network could be strengthened to help overcoming remaining accessibility and connectivity gaps and ensuring the broadest possible and most effective coverage of new infrastructure quality parameters.

The proposal defines measures targeted at an alignment of standards and requirements between the two network layers (comprehensive and core networks) in fields such as railway infrastructure, alternative fuels or urban nodes.

Conclusions on effectiveness

The TEN-T Regulation, overall, has been very effective in identifying thousands of projects on the basis of a single Europe-wide policy framework.

The framework for identifying projects on the network is maintained in the proposal.

However there remain problems of delays for a number of projects caused by complex preparatory procedures, remaining divergences between agreed European objectives and national infrastructure and investment planning or limited EU level governance tools.

The proposal

defines measures to ensure alignment of national interests and responsibilities with TEN-T objectives, while respecting subsidiarity.

TEN-T implementation could be further enhanced – especially in the light of the new challenges and objectives (decarbonisation, digitalisation and increasing risks of unforeseen crisis events)

The proposal defines measures further strengthening existing EU instruments (e.g. core network corridors, work plans, implementing decisions of the Commission). Furthermore it defines measures targeted at improving the resilience of the network.

T

he instrument of the core network corridors, including the European Coordinators, has found to be both highly relevant and effective.

The proposal further develops and extends the corridor concept and strengthens the role of the European Coordinators

Conclusions on efficiency

In relation to the reporting and monitoring obligations set out in the TEN-T Regulation there is some room for streamlining and strengthening these tools.

The proposal defines measures streamlining monitoring instruments and facilitating reporting.

The coordination between Core Network Corridors and Rail Freight corridors has led to certain efficiency gains but there is untapped potential in a better alignment between the two instruments in terms of investment planning and project identification.

The proposal ensures the geographical alignment of both corridor instruments into European Transport Corridors and further strengthen the coordination between the two instruments.

Conclusions on coherence and coordination

Achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal would require that the TEN-T infrastructure is fully aligned with the provisions resulting from the other policy initiatives in the fields of alternative fuels (AFIR), FuelEU Maritime and the ReFuelEU Aviation.

The proposal ensures full alignment with other policy initiatives on alternative fuels.

Need to enhance coherence with the challenges of the digital transition and other new technologies

The proposal ensures full alignment with other policy initiatives on intelligent transport systems.

Conclusions on EU added value

The added value of TEN-T policy overall has always been strongly affirmed by Member States, regions, cities and industrial stakeholders. TEN-T policy also attracts increasing interest outside the EU, notably in neighbouring States but also in other regions of the world, for example in relation to the extension of land transport connections to Asia.

The approach to third and neighbouring country involvement is maintained. The vision of the EU on the extension of the TEN-T to third countries is addressed in a separate communication of the Commission

Ensuring a common and coherent EU-wide basis for the identification of ‘projects of common interest’ and, correspondingly, for the alignment of planning and implementation efforts of a wide range of actors is a clear and widely recognised and would not have been possible without Regulation (EU) 1315/2013.

The TEN-T framework for a harmonised planning and implementation of the network has been maintained and further developed in the proposal.

Stakeholder consultations

The following stakeholder consultations were carried out during the evaluation phase:

Open Public Consultation:

the Commission as the first step of the formal revision process between the 24th of April and the 17th of July 2019 carried out an Open Public consultation. The questionnaire was available in all official EU languages. This consultation generated more than 600 responses from a wide range of stakeholders, including public authorities (from international to local), infrastructure managers, commercial transport users, civil society and citizens. Importantly, more than 150 stakeholders - including a number of Member States and key European Associations - used this initial step already to submit position papers highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the policy and – notably – its future opportunities and needs. The OPC results were analysed and fed into the overall evaluation process.

Targeted stakeholder consultations:

the approach to consult expert stakeholders designed by the consultant consisted of three main elements: online surveys, interviews and case studies on issues of specific importance. The aim of the targeted consultations was to collect data from specific stakeholder groups at local, national and EU level. Generally, stakeholder views showed a very coherent perception of views and no noteworthy distinction could be found between different stakeholder groups, unless otherwise specified in the evaluation.

Online surveys

:

A survey questionnaire has been implemented between 20 January and 16 March 2020 in order to collect data on stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences with the TEN-T Regulation, its implementation and outcomes to date, and their views on recommendations for future EU policy developments in this area. Overall, more than 2000 stakeholders with expertise in the subjects at stake have been contacted for online surveys. In total 198 valid responses were received.

Interviews

:

In total 44 stakeholders have been interviewed with cross-sections of respondents to the survey and representatives of relevant stakeholder groups. The main aim of these semi-structured interviews was to gain in-depth insights into the implementation of the TEN-T Regulation, progress achieved and success factors/challenges from the perspective of different stakeholders. The global interviews complemented the desk research, open public consultation and global survey to explain the quantitative data obtained and fill in any gaps, support the thematic case studies, and elaborate on key issues where data from other sources were unclear or needed further explanation.

Case studies

:

In addition to the general evaluation of the TEN-T Regulation nine thematic case studies on selected TEN-T policy areas have been performed. They were undertaken in areas in which the Commission’s work during the implementation phase of the TEN-T Regulation has produced evidence that there might be a lack of relevance, both in light of developments over the last years and of foreseeable future developments. Three online workshops with stakeholders comprising EU officials, transport stakeholders and social partners have been developed and implemented to validate the findings, and to discuss conclusions and recommendations of the case studies which related to urban mobility, (digitalisation) and innovation and new technologies.

The following stakeholder consultations were carried out during the impact assessment phase:

An

additional

Open Public consultation

was carried out during the impact assessment phase. It was undertaken between 10 February and 5 May 2021 on the EU Survey website. The consultation was divided into five sections, starting with a general question on the Regulation, followed by questions on additional measures that might be taken in, and the potential focus of, an amended Regulation. The consultation received 496 responses in total. The main issues covered were:

·

Measures enabling the decarbonisation and the reduction of air pollutant emissions in the transport system;

·

Measures related to infrastructure quality and resilience;

·

Measures related to innovation, digitalisation and automation; and

·

Potential foc

us areas for the policy options.

All stakeholder input was used in the process of developing the proposal. While the input received during the evaluation phase was in particular used to define and refine the different measures to be further analysed in the impact assessment, the input received in the impact assessment phase was important to validate the measures and options chosen and thus the approach for the revision of the Regulation.

States

authorities.

A standard triangulation approach was applied to address the evaluation questions, through different angles: desk research, interviews and surveys.

Impact Assessment

The impact assessment has been based on research and analyses done by the Commission. The Commission also contracted an external, independent consultants team (Ricardo Nederland B.V. as leader of the group together with Ricardo-AEA Limited, TRT Trasporti e Territorio srl (TRT) and M-Five GmbH Mobility, Futures, Innovation, Economics (M-FIVE)) to support the impact assessment in specific tasks, i.e. the assessment of the policy options, the comparison of the options, the assessment of the administrative costs as well as the analysis of the open public consultation. The external support study will be published alongside this proposal. In addition, the Baseline scenario has been developed by E3Modelling with the PRIMES-TREMOVE model, drawing on the MIX scenario underpinning the impact assessments of the ‘Fit for 55’ package. ASTRA and TRUST models have been calibrated on this Baseline scenario by M-FIVE and TRT, respectively.

•

Impact assessment

To adequately address the objectives of the TEN-T revision, three policy options (PO) have been assessed in terms of their economic, social and environmental impacts. PO1 aims at updating existing TEN-T infrastructure quality requirements and standards and provides for the adequate infrastructural basis for the deployment of alternative fuels and intelligent transport systems. In addition, it includes measures to harmonise and streamline the existing TEN-T monitoring and reporting tools. In terms of TEN-T network, it also includes a review of the transport network and transport nodes. PO2, building upon PO1, represents a step change by introducing new, more ambitious standards for all transport modes as to contribute to decarbonisation, pollution reduction, digitalisation, resilience and safety of the transport infrastructure system. In addition, a better integration of the urban nodes in the TEN-T is ensured through specific requirements to manage traffic of passengers and freight to/from cities. PO3, being the preferred option, accelerates the completion of the TEN-T by advancing the deadline for the completion of certain standards and network sections from 2050 to 2040 whilst keeping the ambitious standards and requirements introduced through PO2. It also ensures a broad and coherent development on the network, translating into a substantial review of the TEN-T network design.

In terms of results PO3 brings significant economic benefits, notably an increase of 0.4% of GDP in 2030, 1.3% in 2040 and 2.4% by 2050 relative to the baseline. This translates into €57 billion increase in GDP relative to the baseline in 2030, €229 billion in 2040 and €467 billion in 2040. Higher investments on the TEN-T also create employment, leading to an estimated 0.1% increase of employment in 2030 relative to the baseline, 0.3% in 2040 and 0.5% by 2050, equivalent to 200,000 additional employed persons in 2030, 561,000 in 2040 and 840,000 by 2050. PO3 also performs well in shifting freight and passenger transport activity to more sustainable modes of transport. The anticipated implementation of a new passenger rail standard (160 km/h line speed), the introduction of the P400 loading gauge (allowing circulation of semi-trailers on railway wagons) as well as the extension of some rail standards from the core to the comprehensive network, coupled with the extension of the latter, is projected to increase rail transport activity. This is also reflected in a higher rail share in the modal split to the detriment of the road sector. Although the modal share of inland waterway and maritime transport stays broadly stable, the implementation of new standards allows the sector to absorb the projected growth of EU27 traffic volumes and of intra-EU maritime traffic. Moreover, the shift from road to less emitting modes enabled by the bundle of measures included in PO3 are projected to result in CO

2

emissions and air pollution emissions reductions. The reduction in the external costs of CO

2

emissions is estimated at around €387 million relative to the baseline over the 2021-2050 period, expressed as present value, while the reduction in the external costs of air pollution at around €420 million. In addition, improvements of road safety are brought by setting quality standards and related safety features to all network sections above a certain daily traffic threshold reducing the number of fatalities and injured persons. The reduction in the external costs of accidents is estimated at around €3,930 million relative to the baseline over the 2021-2050 period, expressed as present value. The reduction in the external costs of inter-urban road congestion is estimated at around € 2,891 million relative to the baseline over the 2021-2050 period.

In terms of costs the preferred option strikes the best balance between the achieved objectives and the overall implementation costs. The investments to implement all measures under PO3 are estimated at €247.5 billion relative to the baseline, expressed as present value over 2021-2050. In addition, the administrative costs for the private sector are estimated at €8.6 million relative to the baseline, expressed as present value over 2021-2050, and those for the public authorities at €25.4 million. Other impacts, related to noise emissions and potential biodiversity loss, were difficult to quantify since noise impacts strongly depend on the local (traffic) situation and biodiversity on the specific location and characteristics of the infrastructure.

The upgrade of the infrastructure for combined railway transport and of terminals is an important element to ensure that intermodal transport is primarily done by rail, inland waterways or short-sea shipping and that any initial and/or final legs carried out by road are as short as possible. Those infrastructure upgrades will generate opportunities to SMEs even though in some segments also large players exist. Main stakeholders concerned are the railway undertakings in the freight market, the rail freight terminal operators, trucking companies and operators at passenger terminals. In the road sector, improving the rest areas and parking situation for regional and long-distance trucking will benefit the large number of small driver-owned trucking companies, which are actually among the smallest enterprises in the transport domain, as they depend on a dense and quality network of parking areas.

PO3 adds an important dimension to the cohesion objective of TEN-T through the identification of urban nodes and the integration of passenger / freight terminals on the whole EU territory playing a crucial role for regional connectivity. PO3 also stimulates best the resilience and climate change adaptation of the TEN-T infrastructure. Finally, PO3 adds important value to ensure coherence with other policies by reviewing the TEN-T network design (e.g. through the creation of European Transport Corridors, replacing the two existing types of corridors – Core Network Corridors and Rail Freight Corridors).

•

Regulatory fitness and simplification

This initiative is part of the Commission Work Programme 2021 under Annex I (new initiatives) and is not part of Annex II (REFIT initiatives).

It improves the functioning of the TEN-T policy by increasing the efficiency of the regulatory framework as a whole. On top of that, it clarifies certain requirements and concepts. For instance, the concept of Motorways of the Sea as currently defined in the Regulation has been acknowledged by a large number of experts and project promoters as overly complex. The evaluation of the TEN-T Regulation confirms that it would benefit from simplification and integration in an overarching and integrated concept of the TEN-T covering ports, shipping and all other maritime infrastructure elements for the benefit of the entire ‘European Maritime Space’. Another example is the alignment of the Rail Freight Corridors with the Core Network Corridors which will allow optimising the instruments and avoid duplication, for example the requirement to draw up investment plans under the Rail Freight Corridor Regulation which should be simply removed as such investment plans overlap with the work plans which are regularly prepared by the European TEN-T Coordinators.

Two further simplifications that will lead to potential cost savings have been identified:

·

automated data input into the TENtec system allowing an exchange directly from the data source (Member State, infrastructure manager);

·

replacing the

bi

e

nnial

work plans of the European Coordinators and the

bi

e

nnial

progress reporting on the implementation of the TEN-T by the Member States with a work plan including the priorities for the respective corridor development every

four

years, with a brief annual

status

report on the state of implementation of the Corridors, Motorways of the Seas (in future European Maritime Space) and ERTMS.

While the proposal increases the overall implementation costs for authorities, it generates improvements, in particular economic and employment gains and enables more sustainable forms of transport that more than offset the increase in regulatory costs.

•

Fundamental rights

By setting relevant infrastructure requirements, the proposal will strengthen accessibility for all users, thereby enhancing accessibility for persons with disabilities and with reduced mobility and contributing to gender equality.

4.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

The administrative costs relative to the baseline have been estimated in the impact assessment as being moderate, especially compared with the ambitious revision plans under the preferred policy option. Expressed as present value over 2021-2050, administrative costs for the public authorities have been estimated at €25.4 million (i.e. €15.8 million for the European Commission

and €9.6 million for Member States public authorities). In addition, the largest part of investments is estimated to originate from public funding (national public funds, EU funds) and would amount to €244.2 billion relative to the baseline, expressed as present value over 2021-2050.

OTHER ELEMENTS

•

Implementation plans and

monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements

The Commission will follow the progress, the impacts and results of this initiative through a set of governance instruments, based on the TEN-T governance, such as the strengthened European Coordinators and their work plans. Monitoring will be further strengthened in the revised Regulation.

The European Coordinators have in this regard been instrumental as they act as ambassadors of TEN-T policy and mediators for all relevant stakeholders that they gather in so called Corridor Fora. This work will be further boosted through a reinforced role of the European Coordinators. In addition, each European Transport Corridor and the two horizontal priorities will be supported by dedicated studies which monitor the progress made with regard to the fulfilment of standards, deadlines and priority setting. This is for instance reflected in a very close monitoring of all projects planned or ongoing on the TEN-T (so called “project pipeline” analysis and half-yearly “project implementation reports”). Projects are thereby being assessed in terms of their financial maturity as well as their status in terms of permitting and procurement, so that problems e.g. in terms of delays can be easily spotted and interventions being planned by Commission and/or European Coordinators. The new Regulation will also include the possibility to build more than in the past on implementing acts. They will not only foster the priority setting at national level, but also facilitate the monitoring of progress made on the TEN-T against defined and agreed milestones in those implementing acts. As such, they are also a very solid basis for the monitoring of those projects since regular progress can be checked per milestone and appropriate measures taken in case of delays. When adopting these implementing acts, the Member States concerned also agree to a regular reporting on the progress achieved. In terms of monitoring, the progress of the TEN-T will be monitored in terms of the technical completion of the TEN-T infrastructure with the defined TEN-T standards and against the defined deadlines of 2030, 2040 and 2050. The standards and requirements will thereby constitute the key performance indicators against which the success of TEN-T will be monitored (e.g. percentage of length of rail freight sections that are electrified, cater for 22.5 axle load and for 740 m train length; number of maritime ports with a railway access etc.). Next to it, there is a constant monitoring through the so-called TENtec database, a powerful information system which will allow in future an automated exchange of data directly from the data source (Member State, infrastructure manager) in a timely manner.

Detailed explanation of

the

specific provisions of the proposal

The structure of the revised Regulation will deviate from the structure of the current Regulation. It will no longer be organised by network layer (core and comprehensive) but by transport mode, which will allow a better understanding of the various requirements. It will include specific requirements and maps for the European Transport Corridors and the new intermediary deadline of 2040. The first chapters of the Regulation explain the overall objectives of the TEN-T and the stepwise approach to complete the network. It will consist of the following main chapters:

Recitals

The recitals will in particular put the focus on the contribution of the TEN-T to the European Green Deal and the objectives of the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. They furthermore detail the links of the revised TEN-T with other transport policies in the different modes and with policy areas outside of the transport sector e.g. environmental and climate policy, social policy, cohesion policy, foreign policy etc. The recitals furthermore highlight aspects of EU and national infrastructure planning and of funding and financing.

Chapter I: General principles

Chapter 1 lays down the general principles of the TEN-T Regulation. It defines the subject matter and the scope of application of the Regulation. It contains the definitions of the different elements of the Regulation and of the terminology used throughout the text. Furthermore, it introduces the objectives of the Regulation (cohesion, sustainability, efficiency and user benefits) and how they shall be reached. This chapter also provides that the trans-European transport network shall be planned, developed and operated in a resource-efficient way, complying with the applicable EU and national environmental requirements. The following articles describe the geographical dimension of the network structure and the European Transport Corridors (ETC). Finally, chapter 1 describes the principles of the projects of common interest and of the cooperation with third countries.

Chapter II: General provisions

Chapter 2 contains the general provisions of the Regulation specifying the core, the extended core and the comprehensive network as well as the European Transport Corridors (ETCs) and lays out the prioritisation of measures on the different networks.

Chapter III: Specific provisions

Chapter 3 contains the specific provisions concerning the requirements for each mode of transport addressed by the Regulation with a view to the:

·

d

efinition of infrastructure components,

·

t

ransport infrastructure requirements for

the

comprehensive network,

·

requirements for the core

and extended core

network,

·

additional priorities

.

In addition this chapter contains provisions concerning the requirements of the revision applicable to multimodal freight terminals and urban nodes.

Chapter IV: Provisions for smart and resilient transport

Chapter 4 contains additional provisions with regard to the requirements of the Regulation with a view to ICT systems for transport, sustainable services, new technologies and innovation, safe and secure infrastructure, resilience, investments by third countries, maintenance and project life-cycle as well as accessibility for all users.

Chapter V: Implementation of instruments of European Transport Corridors and horizontal priorities

Chapter 5 concerns the implementation of the European Transport Corridors and of the horizontal priorities (European rail traffic management System and European Maritime Space). It describes the instrument of ETC and the horizontal priorities and contains provisions on how they shall be coordinated and governed. The chapter furthermore contains provisions on the implementation tools e.g. the coordinators work plans and the implementing acts.

Chapter VI: Common provisions

Chapter 6 contains the common provisions of the Regulation with regard to reporting and monitoring obligations, the procedures for updating the network and the principles for engagement with public and private stakeholders. It contains provisions concerning the alignment of national plans with EU transport policy. It furthermore contains provisions regarding the exercise of delegation, the committee procedure, the review of the Regulation, the procedures with regards to delays in implementing the network and the possibility of exemptions. Lastly, it outlines the impact of the Regulation on other legislative acts with a view to the need for their amendment.

Annexes:

The Annexes of the Regulation contain detailed maps of the core, extended core and the comprehensive network, lists of transport and urban nodes in the scope of this Regulation as well as the definition of alignment and maps of the European Transport Corridors. It furthermore contains indicative maps for the neighbouring countries as well as specifications for the requirements for the development of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. It also contains an article amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 and a correlation table between Regulation (EU) 1315/2013 and this Regulation.

2021/0420 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

on Union guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 and Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 and repealing Regulation (EU) 1315/2013

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 172 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

,

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)

The

Commission Communication ‘The

European Green Deal

’

of December 2019

sets

a climate neutrality objective

to be achieved by the Union

by 2050

as well as a

clear objective

to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

Th

o

s

e

objective

s

are

set as a target

in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council

.

(2)

Transport emissions represent around 25% of the

Union’

s

total greenhouse gas emissions, and these emissions have increased over recent years.

T

he European Green Deal

therefore

calls for

a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transport in order for the

Union

to become a climate-neutral economy by 2050, while working towards the zero-pollution ambitio

n

.

(3)

The Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy

sets out milestones to show the European transport system’s path towards achieving the objectives of a sustainable, smart and resilient mobility

.

It envisages that r

ail freight traffic

should

increase

its market share

by 50%

by 2030 and double by 2050; transport by inland waterways and short sea shipping

should

increase

its market share

by 25% by 2030 and by 50% by 2050; traffic on high-speed rail

should

double by 2030 and triple by 2050;

at least 30 million zero-emission cars and 80,000 zero-emission trucks should be in operation on

Union

roads by 2030, and nearly all cars, vans and buses and new heavy-duty vehicles should be zero-emission by 2050;

scheduled collective travel under 500 km should be carbon-neutral by 2030 within the

Union

; by 2030, there

should

be at least 100 climate-neutral cities in Europe.

(4)

The realisation of the trans-European transport network creates the enabling conditions in terms of infrastructure basis allowing to make all transport modes more sustainable,

affordable and inclusive,

to make sustainable alternatives widely available in a multimodal transport system and to put in place the right incentives to drive the transition

,

notably by ensuring a fair transition, in line with the objectives presented in

the Council Recommendation (EU)

[…]

of

[

…

]

on ensuring a fair transition towards climate neutrality.

(5)

The

planning, development and operation of the trans-European transport network

should

enable sustainable forms of transport, provide for improved multimodal and interoperable transport solutions and for an enhanced intermodal integration of the entire

logistic chain

,

thereby

contribut

ing

to a smooth functioning of the internal market

by creating the arteries that are necessary for smooth passenger and freight transport flows

across

the Union

. In addition,

the network should aim at

strengthen

ing

economic, social and territorial cohesion

by

ensuring accessibility and connectivity for all regions of the Union,

including a better connectivity of the outermost regions and other remote,

rural,

insular, peripheral and mountainous regions as well as sparsely populated areas.

The development of the trans-European transport network

should

also

enable

seamless, safe and sustainable mobility of

goods and persons in all their diversity

,

and

should

contribute

to further economic growth and competitiveness in a global perspective

,

by establishing interconnections and interoperability between national transport networks in a resource-efficient and sustainable way.

(6)

Growth in traffic has resulted in increased congestion in international transport. In order to ensure the international mobility of passengers and goods, the capacity of the trans-European transport network and the use of that capacity should be optimised and, where necessary, expanded by removing infrastructure bottlenecks and bridging missing infrastructure links within and between Member States and, as appropriate, neighbouring countries, and taking into account the ongoing negotiations with candidate and potential candidate countries.

(7)

The trans-European transport network consists to a large extent of existing infrastructure. In order to

fully

achieve the objectives of the new trans-European transport network policy, uniform requirements regarding the infrastructure should be established.

(8)

The trans-European transport network should be developed

and sustained

through the creation of new transport infrastructure, through the

maintenance

and upgrading of existing infrastructure and through measures promoting its resource-efficient use.

(9)

In the implementation of projects of common interest, due consideration should be given to the particular circumstances of the individual project concerned. Where possible, synergies with other policies should be exploited, for instance with tourism aspects by including, within civil engineering structures such as bridges or tunnels, bicycle infrastructure for cycling paths

, including

the EuroVelo routes

, or with security aspects by including new technologies such as sensors in bridges

.

(10)

In order to achieve a high-quality and efficient transport infrastructure across all modes, the development of the trans-European transport network should take into account the security and safety of passengers and freight movements, the contribution to climate change and the impact of climate change and of potential natural

hazards

and

hu

man-made disasters on infrastructure and accessibility for all transport users

,

especially in regions that are particularly affected by the negative impacts of climate change

.

(11)

When planning, procuring and implementing projects of common interest,

Member States and other project promoters should give due consideration to Directive

(EU) 2021/1187

of the European Parliament and the Council

.

(12)

During infrastructure planning, Member States and other project promoters should give due consideration to the risk assessments and adaptation measures

that seek to improve

resilience

, for example

to climate change

, natural hazards and human-made

disasters.

By providing further incentives to develop sustainable forms of transport and with the implementation of high-level standards for green transport infrastructure

, the realisation of the trans-European transport network will support the “do no significant harm” principle.

(13)

Given the evolution of the Union infrastructure needs and the decarbonisation goals, the Conclusions of the 2020 July European Council, according to which Union expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives and the "do no

significant

harm" principle, within the meaning of Article 17

of the

Taxonomy Regulation

,

projects of common interest should be assessed in

order to ensure that TEN-T policy is

coherent with transport, environmental and climate policy objectives of the Union. Member States and other project promoters should carry out environmental assessments of plans and projects which should include the “do no significant harm” assessment

based on the latest available guidance and

best

practice

. In cases that the implementation of a project of common interest entails a significant harm

to an environmental

or

climate

objective

, reasonable alternatives should be considered.

(14)

Infrastructure projects under the TEN-T Regulation should be resilient to the potential adverse impacts of climate change through a climate vulnerability and risk assessment, including through relevant adaptation measures.

Projects for which an environmental impact assessment must be carried out

sh

ould

be subject to climate proofing

and integrate the costs of greenhouse gas emissions and the positive effects of climate mitigation measures in the cost-benefit analysis. The climate proofing should be undertaken based on the latest available best practice and guidance

. This contributes to the integration of climate change-related risks as well as climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessments into investment and planning decisions under the Union budget.

(15)

Member States and other project promoters should carry out environmental assessments of plans and projects

according to the relevant legislation

in order to avoid or, where avoidance is not possible, to mitigate or compensate for negative impacts on the environment, such as landscape fragmentation, soil sealing and air and water pollution as well as noise, and to protect biodiversity effectively.

(16)

The interests of regional and local authorities, as well as those

of the public concerned

by a project of common interest, should be appropriately taken into account in the planning and construction phase of projects.

(17)

The

definition of the

trans-European transport network should

be

based on a common and transparent methodology

and should represent

the highest level of infrastructure planning within the Union

.

It

should be multimodal, that is to say

it

should include all transport modes and their connections as well as relevant traffic and

travel

information management systems.

(18)

The trans-European transport network

should

be gradually developed

in three steps with the overall aim to realise a multimodal

and interoperable

European wide network of high quality standards

, while respecting the overall

Union

climate neutrality and environmental objectives

: the

completion

of a core network by 2030, of

an extended core network

by 2040 and of the comprehensive network by 2050.

(19)

Next to the deadlines of 2030 and 2050 that have already been introduced under Regulation (EU) 1315/2013

of the Europea

n Parliament and of the Council

, a

n intermediary deadline of 2040 for the compliance of the network with this Regulation should be

added

for the extended core network that

is

part of the European Transport Corridors. The same

intermediary

deadline should also apply for new standards on the core network that have been introduced in addition to the requirements in Regulation (EU) 1315/2013 as to allow for the necessary investments in due time.

(20)

The comprehensive network should be a Europe-wide transport network ensuring the accessibility and connectivity of all regions in the Union, including the

outermost regions and other remote,

rural,

insular, peripheral and mountainous regions as well as sparsely populated areas

, and strengthening

social,

economic

and territorial

cohesion between them.

T

he requirements for the infrastructure of the comprehensive network

should be set

in order to promote the development of a high-quality network throughout

the Union

.

(21)

The comprehensive network should

be sufficiently equipped with

alternative fuels infrastructure in order to ensure that it

effectively supports the transition to zero-emission mobility

, in line with the milestones set in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy.

(22)

In addition

to the core network

, an extended core network

should be

defined on the basis of priority sections of the comprehensive network which are part of the European Transport Corridors.

(23)

The core network

has been

identified on the basis of an objective planning methodology. That methodology has identified the most important urban nodes, ports and airports, as well as border crossing points. Wherever possible, those nodes are

to be

connected with multimodal links as long as they are economically viable and feasible

by

2030. The methodology has ensured the interconnection of all Member States and the integration of the main islands into the core network.

(24)

The core network

with a deadline of 2030

and the

extended core network

with a deadline of 2040

should constitute the

foundation

of the sustainable multimodal transport network

,

represent

ing

the strategically most important nodes and links of the trans-European transport network, according to traffic needs.

They

should stimulate the development of the entire comprehensive network

and

enable Union action to concentrate on those components of the trans-European transport network with the highest European added value, in particular cross-border sections, missing links, multimodal connecting points and major bottlenecks.

(25)

Certain

existing

standards of the core network

should

be extended to the

extended core and

comprehensive network in order to

reap

full network benefits, to increase interoperability between network types and to enable more activity by more sustainable forms of transport, including through higher digitalisation and other technological solutions

.

(26)

Exemptions from the infrastructure requirements applicable to the core

, extended core

and comprehensive network should be possible

only

in duly justified cases

and subject to certain conditions

. This should include cases where investment cannot be justified,

or where there are

specific

geographic

or

significant

physical constraints,

for example in

outermost regions and other remote, insular, peripheral and mountainous regions

or in

sparsely populated areas

, or for isolated or partially isolated networks

.

(27)

The land-side infrastructure network, established through the core

network

, extended core

network

and comprehensive network,

should integrate

with the maritime dimension of the

trans-European transport network

. To this end,

a truly sustainable, smart

,

seamless

and resilient

European Maritime Space

should be created

. It

should

encompass all maritime infrastructure components of the trans-European transport network.

(28)

The European Maritime Space should be implemented in close cooperation with the European macro-regional and sea-basin strategies which provide a suitable European territorial cooperation framework both at transnational Union level and at cross-border level with third countries

.

(29)

The Rail Freight Corridors established on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 913/2010

of the European Parliament and of the Council

and the Core Network Corridors

defined in Regulation (EU)

No

1315/2013

are complementary policy instruments, pursuing closely related objectives, in particular to boost sustainable, efficient and safe transport services. Although cooperation has been fruitful on many aspects, in some cases overlapping of activities and needs for a better exchange of information have been identified. Moreover, the Rail Freight Corridors and the Core Network Corridors are not entirely geographically aligned, limiting the possibility for coordination, for example on issues such as the deployment of the infrastructure requirements of the trans-European transport network or the improvement of the quality of railway services. There is therefore an important untapped potential for streamlining, increased effectiveness and synergies.

(30)

As stated in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, an integration of the Core Network Corridors and of the Rail Freight Corridors

into ‘European Transport Corridors’

is needed to increase synergies

between infrastructure planning and the operation of transport

.

The European Transport Corridors should become

the

instrument

for the development of sustainable and multimodal freight and passenger transport flows in Europe and for the development of interoperable high quality infrastructure and operational performance. As such, they should also be

the tool to realise the vision of creating a highly competitive rail network across

the Union

.

(31)

European Transport Corridors

should

cover the most important long-distance

transport

flows

and c

onsist of

key European transport multimodal axis, based on parts of the

trans-European transport network

,

be multimodal and open to the inclusion of all transport modes covered in this Regulation

and

cross at least two borders and involve at least three transport modes

.

(32)

In order to establish the

trans-European transport

network in a coordinated and timely manner, thereby making it possible to maximise network

effects

, Member States concerned should ensure that appropriate measures are taken to finalise the projects of common interest

of

the

core

, the extended core

and

the

comprehensive network

by

the

given deadlines 2030, 2040 and

2050

respectively

.

To this end, Member States should ensure that there is coherence of the national transport and investment plans with the priorities set out in this Regulation and in the work plans of the European Coordinators.

(33)

It is necessary to identify projects of common interest which will contribute to the achievement of the trans-European transport network and which contribute to the achievement of the objectives and correspond to the priorities established in th

is

Regulation

. Their implementation should depend on their degree of maturity, on their compliance with Union and national legal procedures and on the availability of financial resources, without prejudging the financial commitment of a Member State or of the Union.

(34)

Projects of common interest to develop the trans-European transport network in line with

the

requirements set out in this Regulation have European added value, as they contribute to a high-quality, interoperable and multimodal European network,

increasing sustainability, cohesion, efficiency or user benefits

. The European added value is higher if it leads,

in addition to the potential value for the respective Member State alone, to significant improvements of transport connections or transport flows between Member States or between a Member State and

a

third countr

y

.

Such

c

ross-border projects

should be the subject of priority intervention by the Union in order to ensure that they are implemented.

(35)

Member States and other project promoters should ensure that assessments of projects of common interest are carried out efficiently, avoiding unnecessary delays.

(36)

Projects of common interest for which Union funding is sought should be the subject of a socio-economic cost-benefit analysis based on a recognised methodology, taking into account the relevant social, economic, climate-related and environmental benefits and costs

as well as the life-cycle approach

. The analysis of climate-related and environmental costs and benefits should be based on the environmental impact assessment carried out pursuant to Directive 2011/92/EU

of the European Parliament and of the Council

.

(37)

In order to contribute to the climate reduction targets of the European Green Deal of a 90% cut in

greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,

measures to mitigate

the greenhouse gas impacts of projects of common interest in the form of new, extended or upgraded transport infrastructures should be

analysed

.

(38)

Cooperation with third countries

, including neighbouring countries,

is necessary in order to ensure connection and interoperability between the infrastructure networks

of the Union and those countries

.

In view of this

, where appropriate

, the Union should

promote projects of common interest with those countries

, assessing and ensuring that the objectives and requirements of the trans-European transport network are complied with in order to ensure the interoperability of the

Union

network.

(39)

To achieve transformation of

the transport sector into a truly multimodal system of sustainable and smart mobility services

, the Union

should

build a high quality

transport

network with rail services

meeting minimum

line

speed

.

C

ompetitive passenger rail has a high

potential

for the decarbonisation of transport. There is the

need to develop a coherent

and

interoperable European high speed rail network

linking

its capitals and major cities.

Complementing existing high speed lines with passenger lines at

a minimum line

speed of 160 km/h should

in return lead to network effects, a more coherent network and an increased number of passengers travelling by rail.

The completion of a high-performance network will also facilitate the development and introduction of new or different models of capacity allocation, for example interval-service timetables enabled by the Timetable Redesign (TTR) initiative.

(40)

A more sustainable, resilient and

reliable

rail freight network across Europe

should be established

to

contribute to the

competitiveness of combined transport

.

The infrastructure for combined railway transport and of terminals

should be upgraded to ensure that intermodal transport is primarily done by rail, inland waterways or short-sea shipping and that any initial and/or final legs carried out by road are as short as possible.

(41)

Given the fact that the deployment

of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS)

in Europe is accelerating, and several Member States have already adopted plans to deploy ERTMS on their entire national rail networks by 2040, there is a need to take account of this paradigm shift and set a more ambitious ERTMS deployment deadline for the comprehensive network.

(42)

ERTMS should be deployed in a

continuous

manner not only on the

core

network

, extended core

network

and

comprehensive network, including in the

urban nodes

, but also on

access routes to

multimodal

termin

als. This will

enable

operation

s

with ERTMS only

and boost the business case of railway undertakings

.

(43)

As deployment of a radio-based ERTMS

further contributes to

the

eliminat

ion of

national rules

affecting

operation, Member States should ensure that only radio-based ERTMS will be deployed from

2025

and the entire

trans-European transport

network equipped

with

radio-based ERTMS

by 2050.

(44)

ERTMS deployment should be coupled with a regulatory deadline for decommissioning of class B systems trackside

,

thus making ERTMS the only signalling system used in Member States.

Decommissioning of class B systems trackside will bring about significant maintenance savings for infrastructure managers, as deploying ERTMS and keeping additional trackside systems for

a prolonged period is very costly and complicated.

C

lass B systems

should be removed

in a coordinated way with a sufficient transitional period

,

by

2040,

allowing the railway undertakings to anticipate the change and adopt the most suitable migration strategy.

ERTMS, being a system, requires a synchronised deployment both trackside and on-board and full system benefits only occur when both trains and trackside are equipped.

(45)

Inland w

aterways in Europe are characterised by a heterogeneous hydro-morphology

which hamper

s

a coherent

performance for all waterway stretches.

Inland w

aterways

, especially free flowing stretches, may be heavily impacted by climate and weather conditions.

In order to ensure reliable international traffic, while respecting the hydro-morphology and applicable environmental legislation

,

TEN-T

requirements should

take into account the specific hydro-morphology of each waterway (

for example

free-flowing or regulated rivers) as well as the objectives of environmental

and biodiversity

policies. Such an approach should be considered at river basin level

.

(46)

Being the entry and exit points for the

land infrastructure of the

trans-European transport network, m

aritime ports

play an important role

as cross-border multimodal

nodes

which

serve not only as transport hubs, but also as

gateways for trade,

industrial

clusters

and energy

hubs, for example with regard to the deployment of off-shore wind installations

.

(47)

S

hort sea shipping

can make a substantial contribution to the

decarbonisation of transport

by carrying more freight and passengers

.

The

European Maritime Space

should be

promoted

by creating or

upgrading short-sea shipping routes and

by developing

maritime ports and their hinterland connections

as

to provide an efficient and sustainable integration with other modes of transport.

(48)

Road transport in the

Union

accounts for three-quarters of the total inland freight transport (based on tonne-kilometres performed)

and for around 90% of the total

inland passenger transport

(based on

the total number of passenger kilometres

)

.

G

iven the importance of road transport and the commitment to

improve road safety in line with the milestone of the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy

, there is a need to enhance the road infrastructure from the safety point of view.

(49)

The trans-European transport network

should

ensure efficient multimodality in order to allow better and more sustainable modal choices to be made for passengers and freight and in order to enable large volumes to be consolidated for transfers over long distances.

Multimodal t

erminals

should

play a key role to meet this objective.

(50)

Urban nodes play an important role on the trans-European transport network as

starting point or final destination ("last mile") for passengers and freight moving on the trans-European transport network and are points of transfer within or between different transport modes.

It should be ensured that

capacity bottlenecks and an insufficient network connectivity

within urban nodes do no longer hamper

multimodality along the

trans-European transport network.

(51)

As an effective single framework for tackling urban mobility challenges, urban nodes should develop a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), which is a long-term, all-encompassing integrated

freight and passenger

mobility plan for the entire functional urban

area

.

It

should include

objectives, targets and indicators underpinning the current and future performance of the urban transport system

, at minimum

,

on

greenhouse gas

emissions, congestion, accidents and injuries, modal share and access to mobility services, as well as data on air and noise pollution

in cities

.

(52)

Member States

should establish a national SUMP support programme aimed at promoting the uptake of SUMPs and improving coordination among regions, cities and towns. It should support regions and urban areas to develop high-quality SUMPs and reinforce monitoring and evaluation of the SUMP implementation through legislative measures, guidance, capacity building, assistance and possibly financial support.

(53)

The Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities, set up under the Horizon Europe framework programme, aims to have 100 climate neutral cities in the

Union

by 2030. The cities involved in the Mission will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for others to follow by 2050.

(54)

Multimodal digital mobility services help to enhance the integration of the different transport modes by combining several transport offers into one. Their further development should contribute to nudge behaviours towards the most sustainable modes, public transport and active modes such as walking and cycling.

(55)

I

nformation and Communication Technology (I

CT

)

systems for transport

are necessary in order to provide the basis for optimising traffic and transport operations and traffic safety and improving related services.

Information flows in the transport and mobility network sh

ould

be facilitated, including through the deployment of the

Union

Mobility Data Space.

Information to passengers, including information on ticketing and reservation systems, should be

available

.

(56)

I

ntelligent transport systems and services

as well as new emerging technologies

should

serve as a catalyst for the deployment of intelligent transport systems and services on all roads

of the trans-European transport network

.

(57)

A

dequate planning of the trans-European transport network is required. This also entails the implementation of specific requirements throughout the network in terms of infrastructure,

ICT

systems

, equipment and services

, including the requirements for the alternative fuel infrastructure rollout as defined

in Regulation

(EU) [

…

]

of the European Parliament and of the Council

[

on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure

]

23

. It is therefore necessary to ensure adequate and concerted deployment of such requirements across Europe for each transport mode and for their interconnection across the trans-European transport network and beyond, in order to obtain the benefits of the network effect and to make efficient long-range trans-European transport operations possible.

In order to ensure the deployment of alternative fuels across the entire road network of the trans-European transport network in line with the

targets set

in

Regulation

(EU) […]

(58)

T

he trans-European transport network should provide the basis for the large-scale deployment of new technologies and innovation,

such as 5G infrastructure,

which can help enhance the overall efficiency of the European transport sector

and

capacity to enable secure passenger flow

s

using efficient means

,

make public or greener transport means more attractive for passengers,

and reduce its carbon footprint. This will contribute towards the objectives of the

European Green Deal

and at the same time contribute to the objective of increasing

energy

security for the Union. In order to achieve those objectives, the availability of alternative fuels

and related infrastructure

should be improved throughout the trans-European transport network.

(59)

A

sufficient number of fast recharging points for light and heavy

-

duty vehicles accessible to the public should be deployed across the

trans-European transport

network

. Th

is

aim

should

ensure full cross-border connectivity and allow electric vehicles to circulate throughout the

Union

. Distance-based targets for the

trans-European transport

network as defined in

Regulation

(EU) [

…

]

[

on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure

]

are to

ensure

a minimum of sufficient

coverage of electric recharging points along

the Union

’s main road networks.

(60)

Publicly accessible recharging infrastructure along the

trans-European transport

network as defined in Regulation

(EU) […]

[

on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure

]

should be complemented with requirements on the deployment of recharging infrastructure in multimodal terminals

and for multimodal passenger hubs

, to provide charging opportunities for long haul trucks when they are being loaded or unloaded or when the driver is taking a rest

or for busses in multimodal passenger hubs

.

In order to ensure free circulation, where the terminals

or passenger hubs

receive

Union

or public support, the access for purposes of charging, should be on fair, transparent and non-discriminatory basis, so as to avoid market lock in for specific enterprises or possible distortions of competition. Pricing should be made on transparent and non-discriminatory basis for all authorised undertakings or persons,

where the charging infrastructure is build using

Union

or public funding

.

(61)

Insufficient safety

, security

and reliability of the infrastructure

, caused by

natural

hazards

, including

climate related events and other exceptional occurrences such as

pandemics, human-made disasters such as accidents

,

or disruptions caused by intentional acts such as terrorism and cyber-attacks

,

is

a

major problem for the efficiency

and functioning

of the

trans-European transport network.

For instance

, accidents caused by

s

everal natural disasters due to extreme weather events have interrupted the transport flows significantly in the past years. The

resilience of the transport network

to climate change

,

natural

hazards,

human-made disasters

and

other

disruptions

should hence be

improved

, drawing on the risk assessment and resilience enhancing measures taken by critical entities for the transport sector pursuant to Directive […] on the resilience of critical entities

.

(62)

Taking stock of the experience with regard to the crisis management during the Covid-19 pandemic

and in order to avoid traffic disruptions and contingencies in future, Member States should take into account the security and resilience of the transport infrastructure to climate change,

natural hazards,

human-made

disasters

and other

disruptions

affecting the functioning of the

Union

transport system

,

when planning infrastructure. To that aim, the European Transport Corridors

should

also include important diversionary lines which can be used in case of congestion or other problems on the principal routes. In addition, due to their multimodal nature, one mode can substitute the other in case of emergencies.

(63)

The participation of undertakings, including those, which are owned or controlled by a natural person of a

third

country or an undertaking of a

third

country,

including

those, which are established in a

third

country

,

can accelerate the realisation of the trans-European

transport

network. However,

under specific circumstances, the participation of or contribution by undertakings owned or controlled by a

natural person of a

third

country or an undertaking of a

third

country

to

project

s of common interest

might compromise security and public order in the EU. Without prejudice

and in addition

to the cooperation mechanism pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/452

, greater awareness of such participation

or contribution

is necessary to allow intervention of public authorities if it appears that they are likely to affect security or public order in the

Union

and the participation or contribution does not fall under the scope of

Regulation (EU) 2019/452.

(64)

While maintenance is and will remain the main responsibility of the Member States, it is important that the

trans-European transport

network

– once built – is properly maintained to ensure a high quality of services.

A life cycle approach should be followed when planning and procuring infrastructure projects.

(65)

In order to implement parts of the trans-European transport

network

of highest strategic importance

within the given timescale, a corridor approach

should

be used as an instrument to coordinate different projects on a transnational basis and to synchronise the development of the corridor, thereby maximising network benefits.

(66)

European Transport Corridors

should help to develop the infrastructure of the

trans-European transport

network in such a way as to address bottlenecks, enhance cross-border connections and improve efficiency and sustainability. They should contribute to cohesion through improved territorial cooperation.

They should also

address wider transport policy objectives and facilitate interoperability, modal integration and multimodal operations. The corridor approach should be transparent and clear and the management of such corridors should not create additional administrative burdens or costs.

(67)

In agreement with the Member State concerned, European Coordinators

should facilitate the coordinated implementation of the

European Transport Corridors and of the two horizontal priorities, ERTMS and European Maritime Space. They

should facilitate measures to design the right governance structure and to identify

the

priority investment

s

along the European Transport Corridors

and of the two horizontal priorities.

(68)

The European and national frameworks for transport infrastructure planning and implementation as well as

work plans

established by

the European Coordinators

should contribute to

the timely schedule and planning of investments necessary for the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation

.

(69)

The

work plan

s of the European Coordinators

should be used

to promote cooperation between all relevant stakeholders, to strengthen

complementarity with actions by Member States

and infrastructure managers and in particular to set the milestones and priorities for investments

.

Based on the work plans

,

the Commission should adopt implementing

acts

setting out the priorities for infrastructure planning and for funding.

(70)

The technical basis of

the

maps

specifying the trans-European transport network

is provided by the interactive geographical and technical information system for the trans-European transport network (TENtec)

.

(71)

Taking into account t

he

Union

Action Plan on Military Mobility of March 2018

the Commission

should

assess the need to adapt the trans-European transport network to

reflect the military use of the infrastructure

.

Based on the gap analysis between the trans-European transport network and the military requirements

additional roads and railways should be included in the trans-European network to enhance the synergies between civilian and military transport networks.

(72)

In order to maximise consistency between the guidelines and the programming of the relevant financial instruments available at Union level, trans-European transport network funding should comply with this Regulation and be based, in particular, on Regulation (EU) No 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council

.

In addition, network funding

should

also build on

funding

and financing instruments provided under other Union law, including InvestEU, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, Cohesion Policy, Horizon Europe and other financing instruments established by the European Investment Bank

.

To enable the financing of projects of common interest, references

to ‘multimodal logistics

platforms’, ‘motorways of the sea’ and ‘telematic applications’ in Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 should be respectively construed as references to ‘multimodal freight terminals’, ‘European Maritime Space’ and ‘ICT systems for transport’ as defined in this Regu

lation

.

For the same purpose

,

r

eferences to ‘core network’ in Regulation (EU) 2021/1153

should

be construed as including ‘extended core network’ as defined in this Regulation

.

(73)

The achievement of the objectives of the trans-European transport network, in particular with regard to the decarbonisation and digitalisation of the transport system in the

Union

, requires a robust regulatory framework. Ambitious reforms should be implemented by Member States to address the challenges of sustainable transport as identified in the European Semester. The Recovery and Resilience Facility supports both reforms and investments to make transport more sustainable, reduce emissions, improve safety and efficiency. Relevant measures to that effect are included in approved Recovery and Resilience Plans.

(74)

In order to update the maps and the

list of ports, airports, terminals and urban nodes

included

in

Annex

es

I and II

to

take into account possible changes resulting from the actual usage of certain elements of transport infrastructure analysed against pre-established quantitative thresholds, the power to adopt

delegated

acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of

amendments to

Annexes

I and II

. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate

consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level

, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making

. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts

.

(75)

Some parts of the network are managed by actors other than Member States. However, Member States are responsible for ensuring that the rules governing the network are correctly applied within their territory.

(76)

In order to ensure a smooth and effective implementation of the obligations laid down in this Regula

tion, the Commission supports Member States through the Technical Support Instrument

providing tailor-made technical expertise to design and implement reforms, including those promoting the development of the trans-European transport network.

(77)

In order to

ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing

powers should be conferred on the Commission

as regards

implementing acts which specify reference water levels and minimum requirements per river basin (good navigation status),

which define a single entity for the construction and management of cross-border infrastructure projects of common interest,

which establish a methodology for the urban mobility data to be collected by Member States and implementing acts for each work plan of the European Transport Corridors and the two horizontal priorities as well as for the implementation of specific sections of the European Transport Corridor or for the implementation of specific transport infrastructure requirements of the European Transport Corridor or of the horizontal priorities.

Those

powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council

.

(78)

Since the objectives of this Regulation, in particular the coordinated establishment and development of the trans-European transport network, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the need for coordination of those objectives, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

(79)

It is necessary to amend Regulation (EU)

2021/1153

in order to adapt its provisions with the view to integrating the Core Network Corridors into European Transport Corridors

. The definition and the alignment of the

European Transport Corridors

will be defined in this Regulation and

will

replac

e

the Core Network Corridors as defined in

that Regulation

.

(80)

It is necessary to amend Regulation (EU) No 913/2010

in order to adapt its provisions with the view to integrating the Rail Freight Corridors into European Transport Corridors

.

(81)

Regulation (EU)

No

1315/2013

should be repealed.

ANNEX V

SUSTAINABLE URBAN MOBILITY PLANNING REQUIREMENTS FOR URBAN NODES

This annex sets out the requirements for urban nodes for the development of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans.

1.

Goals and objectives

: A Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan

(SUMP)

shall have as central goal improving accessibility of the

functional

urban area and providing high-quality

, safe

and sustainable

low-

emission

mobility to, through and within the

functional

urban area. It shall notably support

zero-emission

mobility

and the

implementation

of an urban transport system which contributes to a better overall performance of the trans-European transport network

, in particular through the development of

infrastructure for the seamless circulation of zero-emission vehicles as well as

of

multimodal passenger hubs to facilitate first and last mile connections and of multimodal freight terminals serving urban nodes

.

2.

Long-term vision and short-term implementation plan

: A

SUMP

shall include a

–

or be linked to an existing – long term strategy for the future development of transport infrastructure and

multi-modal

services. It shall also include a delivery plan for the short-term implementation of the strategy.

It shall be embedded into an integrated approach for sustainable development of the urban area and linked to relevant land-use and spatial planning.

3.

Integration of the different modes of transport

: A

SUMP

shall promote multimodal transport through the integration of the different modes and measures aimed at facilitating seamless

and

sustainable

mobility. It shall include actions

to increase

the modal share of the

more sustainable forms of transport such as

public transport

, active mobility, and, as appropriate, inland waterway and maritime transport.

It shall also include actions to

promote zero-emission mobility, in particular with regard to the greening of the urban fleet, to

reduce congestion and

to

improve road safety

in particular of vulnerable road users

.

4.

Effective functioning of TEN-T

:

A SUMP

should duly take into account the impact of various urban measures on the traffic flows, both passenger and freight, on the

trans-European transport network

with the aim to ensure seamless transit, bypass, or interconnection through and around the urban nodes

, including of zero-emission vehicles

. It shall in particular include actions to alleviate congestion

, improve road safety

and remove bottlenecks affecting the traffic flows on the TEN-T.

5.

Participatory approach

: The development and implementation of a

SUMP

shall be based on an integrated approach with a high level of cooperation, coordination and consultation between the different levels of government and

relevant authorities. Citizens

as well as representatives of civil society and economic actors shall also be involved.

6.

Monitoring and

performance indicators

:

A SUMP shall include objectives, targets and indicators underpinning the current and future performance of the urban transport system

,

at minimum

,

on

greenhouse gas emissions

, congestion, acci

dents and injuries, modal share and

access to mobility services

, as well as data on air and noise pollution in cities

.

The implementation of a

SUMP

shall be monitored using performance indicators. Member States and the relevant authorities shall implement mechanisms to ensure

that a SUMP is in line with the provisions of this Annex and of

high quality.
