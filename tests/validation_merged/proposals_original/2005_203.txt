Proposal for a

DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008)

(presented by the Commission) {SEC(2005) 1202}

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1) CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

-  Reasons for the proposal

Intercultural dialogue is intimately linked to the fundamental ambition underlying the construction of Europe, namely to bring together the peoples of Europe. This vocation on the part of the Union requires dialogue to be voluntarily declared a priority, in order to call upon European citizens, and all those living in the European Union, to play a full part in managing our diversity, which is enriched by increasing variation and by the changes and additions brought about by globalisation.

Moreover, intercultural dialogue is an instrument which could facilitate the implementation of a series of strategic priorities for the Union.

A European Year devoted to intercultural dialogue constitutes a unique awareness-raising tool for affirming this priority and involving citizens.

-  Background

The Treaty establishing the European Community gives it the task of creating an ever-closer union between the peoples of Europe and of contributing to the flowering of the cultures of Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and also highlighting their common cultural heritage. The key to the success of this task is intercultural dialogue.

In addition, the combined effect of the successive enlargements of the Union, the increased mobility resulting from the single market, old and new migratory flows, more significant exchanges with the rest of the world through trade, education, leisure and globalisation in general, is increasing interactions between European citizens, and all those living in the European Union, and the various cultures, languages, ethnic groups and religions in Europe and beyond.

European citizens, and all those living in the Union temporarily or permanently, should therefore be able to acquire the knowledge, qualifications and aptitudes enabling them to deal with a more open, but also more complex, environment and to manage its difficulties and tensions in order to benefit from the opportunities offered to them by such a society, not only in Europe but also in the world.

At the heart of the European project, priority is given to a strengthened and more structured intercultural dialogue, in order to involve all European citizens and all those living in the European Union, and particularly young people, consistent with the new dialogue-based approach desired by the Commission. Intercultural dialogue appears to be the tool of choice for citizens to manage the complex reality in our societies and galvanise them. In this context it is important to inspire people living in the Union to actively get in touch with other cultures, be it at home or abroad, and thus to contribute to tolerance and mutual respect which are prerequisites for intercultural dialogue.

Intercultural dialogue thus contributes towards achieving a number of the Union’s strategic priorities, in particular:

-  by respecting and promoting cultural diversity in Europe and promoting active European citizenship open to the world and based on common values in the European Union;

-  by including the renewed Lisbon strategy, for which the knowledge-based economy requires people capable of adapting to changes and benefiting from all possible sources of innovation in order to increase prosperity;

-  by promoting the Union’s commitment to solidarity, social justice and greater cohesion in the respect of common values in the European Union;

-  by enabling Europe to make its voice heard in the world and to forge effective partnerships with neighbouring countries, thus extending the zone of stability and democracy beyond the Union and thereby influencing the wellbeing and security of European citizens and all those living in the European Union.

In this spirit, the Commission proposes that 2008 be declared the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.

-  Provisions in force in the field covered by the proposal

There are no provisions in force in the field covered by the proposal concerning intercultural dialogue as such, but many projects financed under various Community programmes contribute directly or indirectly to the development of such a dialogue.

-  Coherence with other policies and objectives of the Union

The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue proposed for 2008 will articulate and give concrete form to a number of fundamental principles of the European Union:

-  The Treaty establishing the European Community gives it the task of creating an ever-closer union between the peoples of Europe and of contributing to the flowering of the cultures of Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and also highlighting their common cultural heritage. It also lays down that "the Community shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty, in particular in order to respect and to promote the diversity of its cultures".

-  The Preamble to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that "the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the Union [...]. The Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these common values while respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe as well as the national identities of the Member States".

The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue will contribute to the achievement of a number of the Union’s strategic priorities, particularly with regard to the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and employment and the Union’s commitment to solidarity, social justice and greater cohesion. It will also enable Europe to make its voice better heard in the world, thus extending the zone of stability and democracy beyond the Union.

Finally, intercultural dialogue forms part of the new approach to dialogue and communication desired by the Commission, by contributing to the dialogue with European citizens and all those living in the European Union. A significant number of Community actions involve the general theme of intercultural dialogue, but with different objectives and aims. Significant intercultural dialogue initiatives have been launched or planned, for example in the fields of culture, lifelong learning, youth, citizenship, combating discrimination and social exclusion, combating racism and xenophobia, policy on asylum and the integration of immigrants, audiovisual policy and research.

In its external relations, the Community carries out numerous Community activities which also contribute significantly to the promotion of intercultural dialogue. An important example is the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership with countries which are also important countries of origin of immigrants into the EU. This partnership comprises inter alia a programme for youth exchanges, and two intercultural dialogue programmes on cultural heritage and audio-visual media. The flagship action has been the creation in 2005 of the Anna Lindh Foundation for the Dialogue between cultures in Alexandria, Egypt. The European Year will provide an opportunity to strengthen this “mainstreaming” in all relevant Community programmes and actions in 2008 in order to raise the profile and increase the overall impact of these actions in the context of the Year. This will make it possible to promote a consistent image of the multiplicity of Community actions contributing to the intercultural dialogue while developing synergies between programmes. It will also make it possible to diversify actions by listening to European citizens, and all those living in the European Union, in their different environments and involving them in the search for appropriate forms of dialogue.

Actions during the Year may thus be supported by a critical mass of specific intercultural dialogue projects in a number of sectors. All these projects (and the programmes supporting them) will benefit from the raised profile accorded by the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.

Preparation for the Year will need to be closely coordinated with the preparation for and implementation of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All in 2007[1] in order to maximise synergies and complementarity between these two initiatives.

The European Year is primarily aimed at the Member States of the European Union. The candidate countries will be closely associated with the Year through other initiatives for promoting intercultural dialogue, which will be developed within relevant cooperation and dialogue frameworks, in particular the civil society dialogue between the European Union and the candidate countries.

The intercultural dialogue within the EU being inextricably linked to our endeavours of promoting dialogue among cultures and civilizations internationally, it will also be important to ensure complementarity between the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and all external aspects of promoting intercultural dialogue initiatives developed within appropriate frameworks, including with those EFTA countries which are party to the EEA agreement, the countries of the western Balkans and the partner countries of the European neighbourhood policy.

Any cooperation initiative with third countries, particularly developing countries, which is relevant with regard to the intercultural dialogue objectives of the Year will require close appropriate coordination.

2) CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ANALYSES

-  Consultation of interested parties

Intercultural dialogue is a horizontal issue concerning all sectors of society. There is no specialist sector or player specific to it. There is no all-inclusive formula or favoured setting for intercultural dialogue. All European citizens, and all those living in the European Union, are concerned and should be invited to take part in this dialogue. Given the existence of a recent diversified series of relevant consultations, particularly in the context of preparing the new generation of programmes for education, culture, youth and citizenship, another specific consultation exercise was not considered necessary for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.

-  Obtaining and using expertise

The use of external experts was not necessary.

-  Impact analysis

No further action : the absence of any action other than that already implemented in specific and sectoral actions would distract attention from a political priority of the Union, and would above all give rise to opportunity costs:

Not enabling “mainstreaming” actions implemented on a significant scale in a number of areas to achieve critical mass and an overall profile; limiting the scope of intercultural dialogue to sectors where appropriate programmes exist and not enabling other areas or trans-sectoral approaches to intercultural dialogue to be explored; not enabling actions so far undertaken to reach audiences beyond the specific environments (e.g.: educational communities, university specialists, cultural players, etc.) to which they are often confined; not enabling broader cooperation, coordination and synergy between them; making the involvement of the general public and of European society as a whole more difficult.

Regulatory action : Article 151 of the Treaty excludes "any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States". Thus any regulatory instrument should be ruled out.

Horizontal or “mainstreaming” approach : this approach has already been implemented to a significant extent in many areas and should continue. However, this option in itself does not make it possible to achieve critical mass and a sufficient profile. The scope of intercultural dialogue would be limited to those sectors for which there are appropriate programmes and would not permit exploration of other areas or trans-sectoral approaches.

Multiannual programme and/or action plan : experience so far has shown that such an option would be premature. As a first stage, it is essential to test the situation in the field. The appropriate nature of a multiannual programme or action plan could derive from the experience of the European Year but should not be presumed at this stage.

The option proposed is a European Year centred on three action lines concentrating on showcasing and communication. These action lines are, in turn, based on the richness and diversity of a critical mass of specific projects to be implemented in 2008 through Community programmes and other relevant actions.

The Commission has carried out an impact analysis under its legislative and work programme, and the report is available at:

http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/education_culture/evalreports/index_en.htm.

3) LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL

-  Summary of the objectives of the action and the proposed measures

The overall objectives of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue are as follows:

-  to promote intercultural dialogue as an instrument to assist European citizens, and all those living permanently or temporarily in the European Union, in acquiring the knowledge, qualifications and aptitudes to enable them to deal with a more open but also more complex environment and to overcome any difficulties in order to benefit from the opportunities provided by a diverse and dynamic society, not only in Europe but also in the world;

-  to raise the awareness of European citizens, and all those living in the European Union, of the importance of developing active European citizenship[2] which is open to the world, respectful of cultural diversity and based on common values in the European Union of respect for human dignity, liberty, equality, non-discrimination, solidarity, the principles of democracy and the rule of law as well as respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.

The specific objectives of the action will be to contribute to:

-  raising the profile and increasing the coherence of all Community programmes and actions contributing to intercultural dialogue.

Intercultural dialogue is generally a factor in Community policies and instruments. Community initiatives in this field have led to a number of specific projects dealing with intercultural dialogue from a number of points of view and with different sectors of society. These initiatives have also made it possible to involve civil society in the search for forms of dialogue adapted to the experience of citizens. However, the overall impact and profile of Community action in this field need to be strengthened.

In general, intercultural dialogue may be tackled in each relevant Community programme or action where this is compatible with its conception and management.

The Year will also need to facilitate the identification of relevant Community actions for project promoters which touch on intercultural dialogue and the development of synergies between these actions. The Year will help to increase the value of Community action in this field and should also increase its coherence and effectiveness.

-  Highlighting the contribution of different cultures to our heritage and ways of life; raising the awareness of European citizens and all persons living in the European Union, particularly young people, of the importance of seeking the means to use intercultural dialogue to realise an active European citizenship open to the world, respectful of cultural diversity and based on common values in the European Union.

-  Contributing to innovation and to the horizontal and trans-sectoral dimension of approaches aimed at promoting intercultural dialogue, particularly among young people.

In particular, the Year will need to underline the promotion and development of initiatives bringing together different communities and sectors of society and looking at intercultural dialogue from a multiple perspective. In promoting this trans-sectoral cooperation, the Year will contribute indirectly to the exchange of good practice and experiences between the sectors with regard to promoting intercultural dialogue.

The Year will be developed around three types of action, which constitute the operational objectives:

-  actions on a Community scale: an information campaign promoting the objectives of the European Year (including its position at national level), surveys and studies on a Community scale, with the aim of assessing and reporting on the preparation for, effectiveness and impact of and long-term follow-up to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue;

-  grants for actions on a Community scale: a limited number of emblematic actions on a European scale aimed at raising awareness, particularly among young people, of the objectives of the European Year may receive Community aid of up to 80% of the total cost;

-  co-financing of actions on a national scale with a strong European dimension: actions at national level may meet the requirements for receiving Community aid of up to 50% of the total cost.

The Community may provide non-financial support, including written authorisation to use the logo and other material associated with the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, to initiatives from public or private organisations, in so far as they can assure the Commission that the initiatives in question are or will be carried out during 2008 and are likely to make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Initiatives organised in third countries in association or cooperation with the Year, but not supported financially by it, may also benefit from non-financial support from the Community and use the logo and other material associated with the Year.

-  Legal basis

Article 151 of the EC Treaty.

-  Principle of subsidiarity

The principle of subsidiarity applies in so far as the proposal does not affect an area where the Community has exclusive competence.

The objectives of the proposal may not be achieved to a sufficient extent solely by the action of Member States for the following reasons:

-  promoting intercultural dialogue requires action on a variety of fronts and at a number of levels, in fields where national and local authorities have very broad competence (particularly in cultural and education policies). The Community has a supplementary role in so far as its action, while concentrated on the individual citizen, would have more effect at Community level than that of the Member States. Action at national level alone would risk limiting the scope of intercultural dialogue and taking insufficient account of the European citizenship dimension associated with the dialogue.

The objectives of the proposal may be better achieved through Community action for the following reasons:

-  in the context of the implementation of the relevant Community programmes, intercultural dialogue will be tackled whenever possible. This strengthening of the “mainstreaming” of intercultural dialogue in Community programmes will make it possible not only to have a critical mass of European-scale intercultural dialogue projects and initiatives but will also provide a series of networks for involving the general public;

-  European Years are typically designed to involve a wide variety of audiences in order to raise awareness of a specific theme. The scale of participation in a limited time frame may help to enhance the Union’s political priorities;

-  apart from the effects of this strengthening of the mainstreaming of intercultural dialogue within Community programmes, the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue will concentrate on actions with a clear Community added value, leaving it to Member States to mobilise players at regional and local level in accordance with individual situations.

-  Principle of proportionality

As the Year is based on a critical mass of projects supported by Community programmes, it may carry out a significant Community development action with a budget estimated at 10 million €. The dynamic created by the Year will have to mobilise additional finance. Non-financial support actions may be used to increase the number of actions using the Year’s communication tools and thus raise its profile.

The Year in no way limits action at national level and restricts itself to giving it a Community impulse. In addition, the intervention methods adopted are simple and impose no disproportionate management constraints for administrations tasked with implementing the Year.

The actions envisaged here and their financing do not go beyond what is necessary for achieving the objectives, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

-  Choice of instruments

The issue of intercultural dialogue is not subject to normative actions. A Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council is the most appropriate instrument for establishing an appropriate framework for development.

4) BUDGETARY IMPACT

The budget scheduled for the Year is 10 million €.

Proposal for a

DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first indent of Article 151(5) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[3],

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[4],

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[5],

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[6],

Whereas:

(1) The Treaty establishing the European Community gives it the task of creating an ever-closer union between the peoples of Europe and of contributing to the flowering of the cultures of Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and also highlighting their common cultural heritage.

(2) The combined effect of the successive enlargements of the Union, the increased mobility resulting from the single market, old and new migratory flows, more significant exchanges with the rest of the world through trade, education, leisure and globalisation in general, is increasing interactions between European citizens, and all those living in the European Union, and the various cultures, languages, ethnic groups and religions in Europe and beyond.

(3) European citizens, and all those living in the Union temporarily or permanently, should therefore be able to acquire the knowledge, qualifications and aptitudes enabling them to deal with a more open, but also more complex, environment and to manage its difficulties and tensions in order to benefit from the opportunities offered to them by such a society, not only in Europe but also in the world.

(4) At the heart of the European project, intercultural dialogue appears to be the tool of choice for citizens to manage the complex reality in our societies and galvanise them.

(5) Intercultural dialogue thus contributes towards achieving a number of the Union’s strategic priorities, in particular:

-  by respecting and promoting cultural diversity in Europe and promoting active European citizenship open to the world and based on the common values in the European Union;

-  by including the renewed Lisbon strategy, for which the knowledge-based economy requires people capable of adapting to changes and benefiting from all possible sources of innovation in order to increase prosperity;

-  by supporting the Union’s commitment to solidarity, social justice and greater cohesion in the respect of common values in the European Union;

-  by enabling Europe to make its voice better heard in the world and to forge effective partnerships with neighbouring countries, thus extending the zone of stability and democracy beyond the Union and thereby influencing the wellbeing and security of European citizens and all those living in the European Union.

(6) Intercultural dialogue is an important dimension in many Community policies and instruments in the fields of education, youth, culture, citizenship and sport, combating discrimination and social exclusion, lifelong learning, combating racism and xenophobia, policy on asylum and the integration of immigrants, audiovisual policy and research. At the same time it is an increasing factor in the European Union’s external relations, particularly with regard to the candidate countries, the countries of the western Balkans and the partner countries of the European neighbourhood policy[7].

(7) Building on this diversified basis of Community experiences and initiatives, involving each citizen and European society as a whole in an intercultural dialogue approach is a fundamental step.

(8) For the purpose of the present decision, the notion of “active European citizenship” does not cover only citizens of the European Union as defined in Article 17 of the EC Treaty, but any individual living permanently or temporarily in the European Union.

(9) The common values of the European Union are those defined in Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union.

(10) It is important to ensure complementarity with all Community, national, regional and local actions with a strong intercultural dialogue dimension. The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue should make it possible to raise their profile and increase their coherence while contributing to innovation and to the horizontal and trans-sectoral dimension of approaches aimed at promoting intercultural dialogue.

(11) It will also be important to ensure complementarity between the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and all external aspects of promoting intercultural dialogue initiatives developed within appropriate frameworks, including with those EFTA countries which are party to the EEA agreement, the countries of the western Balkans and the partner countries of the European neighbourhood policy. It will be also important to ensure complementarity with any other initiative of cooperation with third countries, in particular developing countries, relevant for the objectives of intercultural dialogue of the European Year of Intercultural dialogue.

(12) This Decision is addressed to the Member States. The candidate countries should be closely associated with actions under the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue through initiatives to promote intercultural dialogue to be developed within the relevant frameworks for cooperation and dialogue, particularly in the context of the civil society dialogue between the European Union and the candidate countries[8].

(13) This Decision establishes, throughout the duration of the action, a financial framework which will constitute the budgetary authority's prime reference within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[9].

(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. An advisory committee is thus considered appropriate to the type and scale of the action envisaged.

(15) As the objectives of the action envisaged cannot be achieved to a sufficient degree by the Member States owing to the need, in particular, for multilateral partnerships and transnational exchanges on a Community scale and may therefore, owing to the dimension of the action, be better carried out at Community level, the Community may take measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as laid down in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these objectives.

The Community will grant non-financial support, including written authorisation to use the logo, once developed, and other materials associated with the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, in initiatives from public or private organisations, in so far as the latter may provide assurances to the Commission that the initiatives in question are or will be carried out during 2008 and are likely to make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Initiatives organised in third countries in association or cooperation with the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, without being supported financially by it, may also receive non-financial support from the Community and use the logo and other materials associated with the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.

See point 1 of the explanatory memorandum attached to the proposal for a Decision.

5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy

The objectives of the Year, while aimed at each citizen, will be better achieved and have more effect at Community level than at Member State level. The actions envisaged will not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these objectives, respecting the principle of subsidiarity.

The Commission will ensure that activities financed by the Year will complement other Community interventions in areas such as the Structural Funds, education, culture, youth, citizenship, employment, social affairs, equal opportunities, immigration, promotion of fundamental rights, combating racism and xenophobia, audiovisual policy and research. Complementarity with the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All will be particularly important in order to ensure that the two Years support each other in their objectives and actions.
