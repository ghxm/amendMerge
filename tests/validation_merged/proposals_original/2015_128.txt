EUROPEAN COMMISSION

Brussels, 10.6.2015

COM(2015) 282 final

2015/0128(COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

applying the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements (recast)

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

In the context of a people’s Europe, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying the law of the Union so as to make it clearer and more accessible to citizens, thus giving them new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives them.

This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.

For this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent.

2.

On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided

to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable.

3.

The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this

, stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.

Codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.

4.

The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of

Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 of 20 December 2007 applying the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements

. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it

, fully preserving the content of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also necessary to make certain substantive amendments to Article 3(4) and to Article 22

of that Regulation. Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast.

5.

The recast proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 23 official languages, of

Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007

and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in Annex IV to the recast Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty

Ö

on the Functioning of the European Union

Õ

Õ

thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

ò

new

(1)

Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007

Ö

According to

Õ

the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000

Ö

as amended by the Agreement of 22 December 2005

Õ

(‘ACP-EC Partnership Agreement’), Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)

Ö

were

Õ

to enter into force no later than 1 January 2008.

ê

1528/2007 recital 3 (adapted)

(3)

Since 2002 the

Ö

Union

Õ

has been negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements with the

Ö

African, Caribbean and Pacific

Õ

(ACP) Group of States in the form of

Ö

seven

Õ

regions comprising the Caribbean, Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa,

Ö

the East African Community,

Õ

the Pacific Island States, the South African Development Community and West Africa. Such Economic Partnership Agreements

Ö

have to

Õ

be consistent with WTO obligations, support regional integration and promote the gradual integration of the ACP economies into the rules-based world trading system, thereby fostering their sustainable development and contributing to the overall effort to eradicate poverty and to enhance living conditions in the ACP countries. In a first stage, negotiations may be concluded on agreements leading to the establishment of Economic Partnership Agreements covering at least WTO compatible goods arrangements consistent with regional economic and political integration processes, to be complemented as soon as possible by complete Economic Partnership Agreements.

ê

1528/2007 recital 4

(4)

Those agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements for which negotiations have been concluded provide that the parties may take steps to apply the agreement, before provisional application on a mutual basis, to the extent feasible. It is appropriate to take action to apply the agreements on the basis of these provisions.

ê

1528/2007 recital 5 (adapted)

(5)

The arrangements included in this Regulation are to be amended, as necessary, in accordance with the agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements, as and when such agreements are signed and concluded pursuant to Article

Ö

218

Õ

of the Treaty

Ö

on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)

Õ

and are either provisionally applied or in force. The arrangements are to be terminated in whole or in part if the agreements in question do not enter into force within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.

ê

1528/2007 recital 6 (adapted)

(6)

For imports into the

Ö

Union

Õ

, the arrangements in the agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements should provide for duty free access and no tariff rate quotas for all products with the exception of arms. These arrangements are subject to transitional periods and arrangements for certain sensitive products and specific arrangements for the French Overseas Departments. In the light of the specificities of the situation of South Africa, products originating in South Africa should continue to benefit from the relevant provisions of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and South Africa, of the other part

Ö

as amended by the Additional Protocol of 25 June 2005

Õ

(‘TDCA’), until such time as an agreement establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements enters into force between the

Ö

Union

Õ

and South Africa.

ê

1528/2007 recital 8 (adapted)

(7)

The rules of origin applicable to imports made under this Regulation should for a transitional period be those laid down in Annex II to this Regulation. Those rules of origin should be superseded by those annexed to any agreement with the regions or states listed in Annex I

Ö

to this Regulation

Õ

when that agreement is either provisionally applied, or enters into force, whichever is the earliest.

ê

1528/2007 recital 9 (adapted)

(8)

It is necessary to provide for the possibility of temporarily suspending the arrangements set out in this Regulation in the event of any failure to provide administrative cooperation, irregularities or fraud. Where a Member State supplies information to the Commission concerning possible fraud or failure to provide administrative cooperation, the relevant

Ö

Union

Õ

legislation should apply, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97

.

1528/2007 recital 10 (adapted)

a

provide for

general safeguard measures for the products covered by this Regulation.

ê

1528/2007 recital 14

(11)

In view of the particular sensitivity of agricultural products, it is appropriate that bilateral safeguard measures may be taken when imports cause or threaten to cause disturbances in the markets for such products or disturbances in the mechanisms regulating those markets.

ê

1528/2007 recital 15 (adapted)

(12)

In accordance with Article

Ö

349

Õ

of the

Union

Õ

, or those

Ö

Union

Õ

producers whose collective output of the like or directly competitive product constitutes a major proportion of the total

Principles

1. A safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the provisions set out in this Chapter where products originating in regions or states listed in Annex I are being imported in the

Ö

Union

Õ

in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause any of the following:

(a)

serious injury to the

Ö

Union

Õ

industry;

(b)

disturbances in a sector of the economy, particularly where those disturbances produce major social problems or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of the

Ö

Union

Õ

; or

(c)

disturbances in the markets of agricultural products covered by Annex I of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture or mechanisms regulating those markets.

2. In cases where products originating in regions or states listed in Annex I are being imported into the

Ö

Union’s

Õ

outermost regions, a safeguard measure may be imposed in accordance with the provisions set out in this Chapter.

Article 13

Determination of the conditions to impose safeguard measures

1. The determination of serious injury or a threat thereof shall cover inter alia the following factors:

(a)

the volume of imports, in particular where there has been a significant increase, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the

Ö

Union

Õ

;

(b)

the price of imports, in particular where there has been a significant price undercutting as compared with the price of a like product in the

Ö

Union

Õ

;

(c)

the consequent impact on

Ö

Union

Õ

producers as indicated by trends in certain economic factors such as production, capacity utilisation, stocks, sales, market share, the depression of prices or prevention of price increases which would normally have occurred, profits, return on capital employed, cash flow, and employment;

(d)

factors other than trends in imports which are causing or may have caused injury to the

Ö

Union

Õ

producers concerned.

2. The determination of disturbances or a threat thereof shall be based on objective factors, including the following elements:

(a)

the increase in the volume of imports in absolute or relative terms to

Ö

Union

Õ

production and to imports from other sources; and

(b)

the effect of such imports on prices; or

(c)

the effect of such imports on the situation of the

Ö

Union

Õ

industry or the economic sector concerned, including inter alia on the levels of sales, production, financial situation and employment.

3. In determining whether imports are made under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause disturbances in the markets of agricultural products or mechanisms regulating those markets, including regulations  creating Common Market Organisations, all relevant objective factors must be taken into consideration, including one or more of the following elements:

(a)

the volume of imports as compared to previous calendar or marketing years' levels, as the case may be, internal production and consumption, and future levels planned in accordance with the reform of the Common Market Organisations;

(b)

the level of internal prices compared to the reference or target prices if applicable, and, if not applicable, compared to the average internal market prices during the same period of previous marketing years;

(c)

as of 1 October 2015,

in

the markets for products of tariff heading 1701, situations where the

Ö

Union

Õ

average market price of white sugar falls during two consecutive months below 80 % of the average

Ö

Union

Õ

market price for white sugar prevailing during the previous marketing year.

4. In determining whether the conditions referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are met in the case of the

Ö

Union’s

Õ

outermost regions, the analyses shall be restricted to the territory of the outermost region(s) concerned. Particular attention shall be paid to the size of the local industry, its financial situation and the situation of employment.

1. An investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient evidence to justify such initiation.

2. The Member States shall inform the Commission should trends in imports from any of the regions or states listed in Annex I appear to call for safeguard measures. That information shall include the evidence available, as determined on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 13. The Commission shall pass that information on to all Member States within three working days.

ê

37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .14(6)

3. Where it is apparent that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission shall publish a notice in the

Official Journal of the European Union

. Initiation shall take place within one month of the date of receipt of information from a Member State.

The Commission shall provide information to the Member States concerning its analysis of the information normally within 21 days of the date on which the information was provided to the Commission.

4. If the Commission takes the view that the circumstances set out in Article 12 exist, it shall immediately notify the region or states listed in Annex I concerned of its intention to initiate an investigation. The notification may be accompanied by an invitation for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation and arriving at a mutually satisfactory solution.

Article 15

The investigation

1. Following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation.

2. The Commission may request Member States to supply information and Member States shall take whatever steps are necessary in order to give effect to any such request. Where that information is of general interest or where its transmission was requested by a Member State, the Commission shall forward it to all Member States provided it is not confidential; if it is confidential the Commission shall forward a non-confidential summary.

3. In the event of an investigation restricted to an outermost region, the Commission may request the competent local authorities to supply the information referred to in paragraph 2 via the Member State concerned.

4. The investigation shall, whenever possible, be concluded within six months of the initiation of the investigation. In exceptional circumstances, that time limit may be extended by a further period of three months.

Article 16

Imposition of provisional safeguard measures

ê

37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .14(7)

1. Provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that circumstances set out in Article 12 as appropriate exist. Provisional measures shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 21(4), or in cases of urgency, in accordance with Article 21(6).

2. In view of the particular situation of outermost regions and their vulnerability to any surge in imports, provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in proceedings that concern them where a preliminary determination has shown that imports have increased. Provisional measures shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 21(4), or, in cases of urgency, in accordance with Article 21(6).

ê

1528/2007

3. Where a Member State requests immediate intervention by the Commission and where the conditions in paragraph 1 or 2 are met, the Commission shall take a decision within five working days of receiving the request.

4. Provisional measures may take the form of an increase in the customs duty on the product concerned up to a level which does not exceed the customs duty applied to other WTO members, or tariff quotas.

5. Provisional measures shall not apply for more than 180 days. Where provisional measures are restricted to outermost regions, they may not apply for more than 200 days.

6. Should the provisional safeguard measures be repealed because the investigation shows that the conditions laid down in Articles 12 and 13 are not met, any duty collected as a result of those provisional measures shall be refunded automatically.

ê

37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .14(8)

Article 17

Where bilateral safeguard measures are deemed unnecessary, the investigation and proceeding shall be terminated in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(5).

ê

1528/2007

Article 18

Imposition of definitive measures

1. Where the facts as finally established show that the circumstances set out in Article 12, as appropriate, are met, the Commission shall request consultations with the region or state concerned meeting in the context of the appropriate institutional arrangement set up in the relevant agreements permitting a region or state to be included in Annex I with a view to seeking a mutually acceptable solution.

ê

37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .14(9)

2. If the consultations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article do not lead to a mutually satisfactory solution within 30 days of the matter being referred to the region or state concerned, a decision to impose definitive bilateral safeguard measures shall be taken by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 21(5) within 20 working days of the end of the consultation period.

ê

1528/2007 (adapted)

3. Definitive measures may take one of the following forms:

(a)

a suspension of the further reduction of the rate of import duty for the product concerned originating in the region or state concerned;

(b)

an increase in the customs duty on the product concerned up to a level which does not exceed the customs duty applied to other WTO members;

(c)

a tariff quota.

4. No bilateral safeguard measure shall be applied on the same product from the same region or state less than one year after previous such measures have lapsed or been removed.

Article 19

Duration and review of safeguard measures

1. A safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury or disturbances. That period shall not exceed two years, unless it is extended under paragraph 2. Where the measure is restricted to one or several of the outermost region(s) of the

Ö

Union

Õ

, the period of application may not exceed four years.

2. The initial period of duration of a safeguard measure may exceptionally be extended provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury or disturbances.

3. Extensions shall be adopted in accordance with the procedures of this Regulation applying to investigations and using the same procedures as the initial measures.

The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. In the case of a measure restricted to outermost regions, that limit shall be extended to eight years.

4. If the duration of a safeguard measure exceeds one year, it shall be progressively liberalised at regular intervals during its period of application, including any extension.

Consultations with the region or state concerned shall be held periodically in the relevant institutional bodies of the agreements, with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.

Article 20

Surveillance measures

1. Where the trend in imports of a product originating in an ACP State is such that they could cause one of the situations referred to in Article 12, imports of that product may be subject to prior

Ö

Union

Õ

surveillance.

ê

37/2014 Art. 1 and Annex .14(10)

2. The decision to impose surveillance shall be taken by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 21(4).

3. Surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Unless otherwise provided, they shall cease to be valid at the end of the second six-month period following the first six months after the measures were introduced.

4. Surveillance measures may be restricted to the territory of one or more

Ö

Union

Õ

outermost region(s) where necessary.

5. The decision to impose surveillance measures shall be communicated immediately to the appropriate institutional body set up in the relevant agreements permitting a region or state to be included in Annex I for information.

General requirements

1. For the purpose of the application of the provisions of this Regulation, the following products shall be considered as originating in the ACP States of Annex I, hereafter, for the purpose of this Annex, referred to as ‘ACP States’:

(a)

products wholly obtained in the ACP States within the meaning of Article 3 of this Annex;

(b)

products obtained in the ACP States incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the ACP States within the meaning of Article 4 of this Annex.

2. For the purpose of the implementation of paragraph 1, the territories of the ACP States shall be considered as being one territory.

Originating products made up of materials wholly obtained or sufficiently worked or processed in two or more ACP States shall be considered as products originating in the ACP State where the last working or processing took place, provided the working or processing carried out there goes beyond that referred to in Article 5 of this Annex.

3. For products listed in Appendix 10, paragraph 2 shall apply only after 1 October 2015.

Article 3

Wholly obtained products

1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the ACP States or in the

Ö

Union

Õ

:

(a)

mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;

(b)

vegetable products harvested there;

(c)

live animals born and raised there;

(d)

products from live animals raised there;

(e)

products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;

(f)

products of aquaculture, including mariculture, where the fish are born and raised there;

(g)

products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters by their vessels;

(h)

products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products covered by point (g);

(i)

used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;

(j)

waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;

(k)

products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;

(l)

goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in points (a) to (k).

2. The terms ‘their vessels’ and ‘their factory ships’ in points (g) and (h) of paragraph 1 shall apply only to vessels and factory ships

Ö

which

Õ

:

(a)

are registered in a Member State or in an ACP State;

(b)

sail under the flag of a Member State or of an ACP State;

(c)

meet one of the following conditions:

(i)

they are at least 50 % owned by nationals of the ACP State or of a Member State

or

(ii)

they are owned by companies

Ö

which

Õ

;

–

have their head offices and their main places of business in the ACP State or in a Member State; and

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the

Ö

Union

Õ

shall, upon request by an ACP State, recognise vessels chartered or leased by the ACP State to undertake fisheries activities in its exclusive economic zone as ‘their vessels’ under the following conditions:

(a)

that the ACP State offered the

Ö

Union

Õ

the opportunity to negotiate a fisheries agreement and the

Ö

Union

Õ

did not accept that offer;

(b)

that the charter or lease contract has been accepted by the Commission as providing adequate opportunities for the development of the capacity of the ACP State to fish on its own account and in particular as conferring on the ACP State the responsibility for the nautical and commercial management of the vessel placed at its disposal for a significant period of time.

Article 4

Sufficiently worked or processed products

1. For the purposes of this Annex, products which are not wholly obtained shall be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed in the ACP States or in the

Ö

Union

Õ

, when the conditions set out in the list in Appendix 2 or, alternatively, in Appendix 2A are fulfilled. The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Regulation, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that:

(a)

their total value does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the product;

(b)

none of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are exceeded through the application of this paragraph.

The notification to the Commission shall indicate the development benefits to the fisheries sector in that State, and shall include the necessary information concerning the species concerned, the products to be manufactured and an indication of the respective quantities to be involved.

(b)

A report to the

Ö

Union

Õ

on the implementation of point (a) shall be drawn up by the Pacific ACP State no later than three years after the notification.

(c)

Point (a) shall apply without prejudice to sanitary and phytosanitary measures in force in the

2. All the operations carried out in either the ACP States or the

Ö

Union

Õ

on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.

Article 6

Cumulation of origin

Cumulation with the OCT and the

Ö

Union

Õ

1. Materials originating in the

Ö

Union

Õ

or in the OCT shall be considered as materials originating in the ACP States when incorporated into a product obtained there.

The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 per cent. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, before any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.

5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Commission. When carrying out that review, the Commission shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For that purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.

TITLE VII

FINAL PROVISION

Article 38

Appendices

The Appendices to this Annex shall form an integral part thereof.

Appendix 1

Introductory notes to the list in this Annex

Note 1:

The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 4 of this Annex.

Note 2:

1. First two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an ‘ex’, this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.

2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.

3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.

4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.

Note 3:

1. The provisions of Article 4 of this Annex concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the

Ö

Union

Õ

or in the ACP States.

Example:

An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from ‘other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging’ of heading No ex7224.

If this forging has been forged in the

Ö

Union

Õ

from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the

Ö

Union

Õ

. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.

2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. This if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.

3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that ‘materials of any heading’ may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression ‘manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No …’ means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.

4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.

Example:

The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and those chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.

5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).

Example:

The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.

However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.

Example:

In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth — even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn — that is the fibre stage.

6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.

Note 4:

1. The term ‘natural fibres’ is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.

2. The term ‘natural fibres’ includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.

3. The terms ‘textile pulp’, ‘chemical materials’ and ‘paper-making materials’ are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.

4. The term ‘man-made staple fibres’ is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.

Note 5:

1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).

2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials:

–

silk,

–

wool,

–

coarse animal hair,

–

fine animal hair,

–

horsehair,

–

cotton,

–

paper-making materials and paper,

–

flax,

–

true hemp,

–

jute and other textile baste fibres,

–

sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,

–

coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,

–

synthetic man-made filaments,

–

artificial man-made filaments,

–

current conducting filaments,

–

synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,

–

synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,

–

synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,

–

synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,

–

synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,

–

synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,

–

synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,

–

synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,

–

other synthetic man-made staple fibres,

–

artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,

–

other artificial man-made staple fibres,

–

yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,

–

yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,

–

products of heading No 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,

–

other products of heading No 5605.

Example:

A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.

Example:

A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.

Example:

Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.

Example:

If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.

3. In the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped’ this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.

4. In the case of products incorporating ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film’, this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.

Note 6:

1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.

Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings are not being regarded as trimmings or accessories.

2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.

3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.

For example

, if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.

4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

Note 7:

1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:

(g)

Polymerisation;

(h)

Alkylation;

(i)

Isomerisation.

2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:

The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;

(m)

In respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C by the ASTM D 86 method;
