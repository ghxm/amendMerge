EUROPEAN COMMISSION

Brussels, 17.7.2020

COM(2020) 323 final

2020/0145(COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

on cross-border payments in the Ã–Â UnionÂ Ã• Community and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001(codification)

(Text with EEA relevance)

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

In the context of a peopleâ€™s Europe, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying the law of the Union so as to make it clearer and more accessible to citizens, thus giving them new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives them.

This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules.

For this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent.

2.

On 1Â AprilÂ 1987 the Commission decided

to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable.

3.

The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (DecemberÂ 1992) confirmed this

, stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time.

Codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal procedure for the adoption of acts of the Union.

Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20Â DecemberÂ 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.

4.

The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of

Regulation (EC) NoÂ 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council ofÂ 16Â SeptemberÂ 2009 on cross-border payments in the Community and repealing Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2560/2001

. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it

; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself.

5.

The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in 24 official languages, of Regulation

(EC) NoÂ 924/2009

and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Publications Office of the European Union, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table set out in AnnexÂ II to the codified Regulation.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

on cross-border payments in the

âŒ¦

Union

âŒ«

(codification)

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty

âŒ¦

on the Functioning of the European Union

âŒ«

, and in particular Article

âŒ¦

114

âŒ«

(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank

,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

ðŸ¡»

(1)

Regulation (EC) NoÂ 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council

has been substantially amended several times

. In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be codified.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 1 (adapted)

(2)

For the proper functioning of the internal market and in order to facilitate cross-border trade within the

âŒ¦

Union

âŒ«

it is essential that the charges for cross-border payments in euro are the same as for corresponding payments within a Member State.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 5 (adapted)

(3)

It is not advisable to apply the principle of equality of charges for payment instruments which are mainly or exclusively paper-based, such as cheques, since, by their very nature, they cannot be processed as efficiently as electronic payments.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 6 (adapted)

(4)

The principle of equality of charges should apply to payments initiated or terminated on paper or in cash which are processed electronically in the course of the payment execution chain, excluding cheques, and to all charges linked directly or indirectly to a payment transaction, including charges linked to a contract. Indirect charges include charges for setting up a permanent payment order, or fees for using a payment card, or debit or credit card, which should be the same for national and cross-border payment transactions within the

âŒ¦

Union

âŒ«

.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 7

(5)

In order to prevent the fragmentation of payment markets, it is appropriate to apply the principle of equality of charges. For that purpose, a national payment having the same characteristics as, or very similar characteristics to, the cross-border payment should be identified for each category of cross-border payment transaction. It should be possible, inter alia, to use the following criteria to identify the national payment corresponding to a cross-border payment: the channel used to initiate, execute and terminate the payment, the degree of automation, any payment guarantee, customer status and relationship with the payment service provider, or the payment instrument used, as defined in point (14) of ArticleÂ 4 of Directive (EU)Â 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council

. Those criteria should not be considered to be exhaustive.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 8 (adapted)

(6)

Competent authorities should issue guidelines to identify corresponding payments where they consider it necessary. The Commission, assisted, where appropriate, by the Payments Committee

âŒ¦

established in accordance with ArticleÂ 85(1) of DirectiveÂ 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

âŒ«

, should provide adequate guidance and assist the competent authorities.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 4 (adapted)

(7)

In order to facilitate the functioning of the internal market and to

âŒ¦

avoid

âŒ«

inequalities between payment service users in the euro area and non-euro area Member

States in respect of cross-border payments in euro, it is necessary to ensure that charges for cross-border payments in euro within the Union are aligned with charges for corresponding national payments made in the national currency of the Member State in which the payment service provider of the payment service user is located. A payment service provider is considered to be located in the Member State in which it provides its services to the payment service user.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 5 (adapted)

(8)

Currency conversion charges represent a significant cost of cross-border payments when different currencies are in use in the Member State of the payer and the Member State of the payee. ArticleÂ 45 of Directive (EU)Â 2015/2366 requires charges and the exchange rate used to be transparent, ArticleÂ 52(3) of that Directive specifies information requirements with regard to payment transactions covered by a framework contract and ArticleÂ 59(2) of that Directive covers the information requirements for parties offering currency conversion services at an automated teller machine (ATM) or at the point of sale. It is necessary to

âŒ¦

lay down

âŒ«

additional measures in order to protect consumers against excessive charges for currency conversion services and ensure that consumers are given the information they need to choose the best currency conversion option.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 6 (adapted)

(9)

âŒ¦

Those

âŒ«

measures should be appropriate, adequate and cost-effective. At the same time, in situations in which the payer is confronted with different currency conversion options at an ATM or at the point of sale, the information provided should enable comparison, to allow the payer to make an informed choice.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 7

(10)

To achieve comparability, currency conversion charges for all card-based payments should be expressed in the same way, namely as percentage mark-ups over the latest available euro foreign exchange reference rates issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). A mark-up might have to be based on a rate derived from two ECB rates in the case of a conversion between two non-euro currencies.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 8 (adapted)

(11)

In accordance with the general information requirements on currency conversion charges laid down in Directive (EU)Â 2015/2366, providers of currency conversion services must disclose information on their currency conversion charges prior to the initiation of the payment transaction. Parties that offer currency conversion services at an ATM or at the point of sale should provide information on their charges for such services in a clear and accessible manner, for example by displaying their charges at the counter or digitally on the terminal, or on-screen in the case of online purchases. In addition to the information referred to in ArticleÂ 59(2) of Directive (EU)Â 2015/2366, those parties should provide, prior to the initiation of the payment, explicit information on the amount to be paid to the payee in the currency used by the payee and the total amount to be paid by the payer in the currency of the payer's account. The amount to be paid in the currency used by the payee should express the price of the goods

âŒ¦

or

âŒ«

services to be bought and might be displayed at the check-out rather than on the payment terminal. The currency used by the payee is in general the local currency, but according to the principal of contractual freedom might in some cases be another Union currency. The total amount to be paid by the payer in the currency of the payer's account should consist of the price of the goods or services and the currency conversion charges. In addition, both amounts should be documented on the receipt or on another durable medium.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 9

(12)

With regard to ArticleÂ 59(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, where a currency conversion service is offered at an ATM or at the point of sale, it should be possible for the payer to refuse that service and to pay in the currency used by the payee instead.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 10

(13)

In order to enable payers to compare the charges of currency conversion options at an ATM or at the point of sale, the payers' payment service providers should not only include fully comparable information on the applicable charges for currency conversion in the terms and conditions of their framework contract, but should also make that information public on a broadly available and easily accessible electronic platform, in particular on their customer websites, on their home-banking websites and on their mobile banking applications, in an easily understandable and accessible manner. This would cater for the development of comparison websites to make it easier for consumers to compare prices when travelling or shopping abroad. In addition, payers' payment service providers should remind payers about the applicable currency conversion charges when a card-based payment is made in another currency, through the use of broadly available and easily accessible electronic communication channels, such as SMS messages, e-mails or push notifications through the payer's mobile banking application. Payment service providers should agree with payment service users on the electronic communication channel through which they will provide the information on currency conversion charges, taking into consideration the most effective channel for reaching the payer. Payment service providers should also accept requests from payment service users to opt out of receiving the electronic messages containing information on the currency conversion charges.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 11 (adapted)

(14)

Periodic reminders are appropriate in situations in which the payer stays abroad for longer periods of time, for example where the payer is posted or studies abroad, or where the payer regularly uses a card for online purchases in the local currency. An obligation to provide such reminders would ensure that the payer is informed when considering the different currency conversion options.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 9 (adapted)

(15)

It is important to facilitate the execution of cross-border payments by payment service providers. In that respect, standardisation should be promoted as regards, in particular, the use of the international

âŒ¦

payment

âŒ«

account number

âŒ¦

identifier

âŒ«

(IBAN)

and the

âŒ¦

business

âŒ«

identifier code (BIC). ]It is therefore appropriate that payment service providers provide payment service users with the IBAN and the BIC for the account in question.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 10 (adapted)

(16)

In order to guarantee the continuous, timely and efficient provision of balance-of-payments statistics

âŒ¦

in the framework of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)

âŒ«

, it is desirable to ensure that it remains possible to collect readily available payments data such as the IBAN, the BIC and the amount of the transaction or basic, aggregated payments data for different payment instruments if the collection process does not disrupt the automated payments processing and could be fully automated. This Regulation does not affect reporting obligations for other policy purposes, such as for the prevention of money laundering or terrorist financing, or for fiscal purposes.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 14

(17)

Competent authorities should be empowered to fulfil their monitoring duties efficiently and to take all necessary measures to ensure that payment service providers comply with this Regulation.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 15 (adapted)

(18)

In order to ensure that redress is possible where this Regulation has been incorrectly applied, Member States should

âŒ¦

provide for

âŒ«

adequate and effective complaint and redress procedures for settling any dispute between the payment service user and the payment service provider. It is also important that competent authorities and out-of-court complaint and redress bodies are appointed.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 16 (adapted)

(19)

It is essential to ensure that the competent authorities and out-of-court complaint and redress bodies, within the

âŒ¦

Union

âŒ«

, actively cooperate for the smooth and timely resolution of cross-border disputes under this Regulation. It should be possible for such cooperation to take the form of an exchange of information regarding the law or legal practice in their jurisdictions, or a transfer or takeover of complaint and redress procedures if appropriate.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 17

(20)

It is necessary that Member States lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in national law for failure to comply with this Regulation.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 18 (adapted)

(21)

Extending the application of this Regulation to currencies other than the euro would have clear benefits, especially in terms of the number of payments covered. In order to allow Member States which do not have the euro as their currency to extend the

application of this Regulation to cross-border payments denominated in their national currency, a notification procedure should therefore be

âŒ¦

provided for

âŒ«

.

ðŸ¡»

2019/518 recital 12

(22)

The Commission should submit to the European Parliament, to the Council, to the ECB and to the European Economic and Social Committee a report on the application of the rule equalising the cost of cross-border payments in euro with the cost of national transactions in national currencies and on the effectiveness of the information requirements on currency conversion set out in this Regulation. The Commission should also analyse further possibilities â€“ and the technical feasibility of those possibilities â€“ of extending the equal charges rule to all Union currencies and of further improving the transparency and comparability of currency conversion charges, as well as the possibility of disabling and enabling the option of accepting currency conversion by parties other than the payer's payment service provider.

ðŸ¡»

924/2009 recital 22 (adapted)

(23)

Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States

âŒ¦

but

âŒ«

can

âŒ¦

rather

âŒ«

, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at

âŒ¦

Union

âŒ«

level, the

âŒ¦

Union

âŒ«

may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in ArticleÂ 5 of the Treaty
