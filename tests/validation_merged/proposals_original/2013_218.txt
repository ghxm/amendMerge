Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL adapting to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union a number of legal acts providing for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. /* COM/2013/0451 final - 2013/0218 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           BACKGROUND TO THEPROPOSAL

The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered intoforce on 1st December 2009, substantially modifies the framework for powersthat are conferred upon the Commission by the legislator. It makes a cleardistinction between the powers delegated to the Commission to adoptnon-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certainnon-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts) on the one handand the powers conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts on theother hand. They are subject to entirely different legal frameworks.

In terms of the wording, the definition ofdelegated acts in Article 290(1) is very similar to that of acts which, underDecision 1999/468/EC[1] ("the Comitology Decision"), are subject to theregulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS) established in Article 5a of thisDecision. In both cases, the acts in question are of general application andseek to amend or supplement certain non-essential elements of the legislativeinstrument.

For this reason, the revision of theComitology Decision by the Regulation 182/2011[2]("the Comitology Regulation") left out of its scope Article 5a of theComitology Decision. Article 5a establishing the RPS had therefore to be provisionallymaintained for the purposes of existing basic acts referring to this Article.In this context, the Commission made a commitment to formally adapt thoseexisting provisions providing for RPS to the delegated acts regime.

The Commission issued the followingstatement at the moment of the adoption of the Comitology Regulation[3]:

"As regards legislative acts in force which currentlycontain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the Commissionwill review the provisions attached to this procedure in each instrument itintends to modify, in order to adapt them in due course according to thecriteria laid down in the Treaty. In addition, the European Parliament and theCouncil will be entitled to signal basic acts they consider important to adaptas a matter of priority.

The Commission will assess the results of this process by the end of2012 in order to estimate how many legislative acts containing references tothe regulatory procedure with scrutiny remain in force. The Commission will thenprepare the appropriate legislative initiatives to complete the adaptation. Theoverall objective of the Commission is that, by the end of the 7th term of theParliament, all provisions referring to the regulatory procedure with scrutinywould have been removed from all legislative instruments."

2.           OVERVIEW OF THE BASICINSTRUMENTS CONCERNED BY THE ALIGNMENT

At the end of 2012, 288 legislative actsstill containing references to the RPS were identified. Around 60 of them arecurrently in the legislative process and therefore are not concerned by thepresent proposal (those acts are listed for information in point 4 below).

The Commission has carried out a carefulexamination of all legislative instruments still referring to the RPS in orderto analyse whether the RPS measures covered by theComitology Decision meet the criteria of Article 290TFEU.

This is the first of thethree proposals adapting a number of legislative instruments referring to theRPS to the criteria laid down in the Treaty. It provides for a transformationof the RPS into delegated acts for the basic legislative acts which are listedin the annex. It is based on the legal bases of all thebasic acts concerned.

Another separate regulation is proposed for the legislativeacts in the area of Justice which refer to the RPS (COM(2013)452), as those acts were adopted under a legal basis pursuant to Title Vpart III of the TFEU and therefore do not bind all Member States, and are thusirreconcilable with the legal bases of the other basic acts.

Finally, a third proposal will cover theremaining basic acts referring to the RPS which are subject to an on-goinganalysis.

3.           METHOD OF THE ADAPTATIONOF LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS STILL REFERRING TO THE RPS

The approach followed by this proposal isto apply the method used in the Comitology Regulation and to align the basicacts still containing the RPS by way of a framework regulation.

The Comitology Regulation provides for anautomatic alignment of the existing acquis to the new procedures. Article 13 ofthat Regulation stipulates that, where basic acts make reference to theprocedures provided for in the Comitology Decision, the corresponding procedureof the Comitology Regulation applies.

Accordingly, the present frameworkregulation provides that where instruments listed in the annex make referenceto the procedure referred to in Article 5a of the Comitology Decision, theCommission is empowered to adopt delegated acts.

In cases where there are curtailedtime-limits for opposition, in accordance with Article 5a(5)(b) of theComitology Decision, the proposal provides for a time-limit for objection of 1month (Article 2(6) of the proposal).

The proposal adapts the urgency procedureaccording to Article 5a(6) of the Comitology Decision to the urgency procedurefor delegated acts (Article 3 of the proposal).

Adaptation to the delegated act regime willnot affect pending procedures in which an opinion has already been delivered bya committee in accordance with the Comitology Decision.

Basic acts which are adapted to thedelegated acts regime are listed in the annex of the proposal. The list isorganised according to policy areas and chronological order of the adoption ofthe instruments.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

adapting to Article 290 of the Treaty onthe Functioning of the European Union a number of legal acts providing for theuse of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioningof the European Union, and in particular Articles 33, 43(2), 53(1), 62, 64(2),91, 100(2), 114, 153(2)(b), 168(4)(b), 172, 192(1), 207 and 338(1), thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[4],

Having regard to the opinion of theCommittee of the Regions[5],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)       TheTreaty of Lisbon introduced the possibility for the legislator to delegatepower to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application tosupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act.

(2)       Themeasures which can be covered by delegations of powers, as referred to in Article290(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),correspond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure withscrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powersconferred on the Commission [6].

(3)       Itis necessary to adapt to Article 290 of the TFEU a number of legal acts alreadyin force which provide for the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.

(4)       This Regulation should notaffect pending procedures in which the committee has already delivered itsopinion in accordance with Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC before the entryinto force of this Regulation.

(5)       Since the adaptations tobe made by this Regulation concern only procedures, they do not, in the case ofdirectives, need to be transposed by the Member States.

(6)       When the Commissionprepares delegated acts on the basis of the legal acts adapted by thisRegulation, it is of particular importance that it carry out appropriateconsultations, including at expert level. TheCommission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure asimultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to theEuropean Parliament and to the Council,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

1. Where thelegal acts listed in the Annex to this Regulation provide for the use of theregulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 5a(1) to (5) ofDecision 1999/468/EC, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated actsin accordance with Article 2 of this Regulation.

2. Where thelegal acts listed in the Annex provide for the use of the urgency procedurereferred to in Article 5a(6) of the Decision 1999/468/EC, the Commission shallbe empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the urgency procedureprovided in Article 3 of this Regulation.

It shall take effect the day following thepublication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Unionor at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of anydelegated acts already in force.

4. As soon asit adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to theEuropean Parliament and to the Council.

5. An adopteddelegated act shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressedeither by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two monthsof notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if,before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council haveboth informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall beextended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of theCouncil.

6. Where thelegal acts listed in the Annex to this Regulation provide that the time-limitlaid down in Article 5a(3)(c) of Decision 1999/468/EC is curtailed pursuant toArticle 5a(5)(b) of that Decision, the periods laid down in paragraph 5 of thisArticle shall be set at one month.

Article 3

1. Delegated acts adopted under thisArticle shall enter into force without delay and shall apply as long as noobjection is expressed in accordance with paragraph 2. The notification of a delegated act to the European Parliament and tothe Council shall state the reasons for the use of the urgency procedure.

2. Either the European Parliament or theCouncil may object to a delegated act in accordance with the procedure referredto in Article 2(5). In such a case, the Commission shall repeal the act withoutdelay following the notification of the decision toobject by the European Parliament or by the Council.

Article 4

This Regulationshall not affect pending procedures in which a committee has already deliveredits opinion in accordance with Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

This Regulation shall be bindingin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
