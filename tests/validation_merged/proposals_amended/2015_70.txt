Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL fixing the adjustment rate provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 for direct payments in respect of calendar year 2015 /* COM/2015/0141 final - 2015/0070 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

The Treaty on the Functioning of theEuropean Union lays down the fundamental rule governing Union financing thatthe annual budget of the Union must comply with the Multiannual FinancialFramework (MFF).

In order to support the agricultural sectorin case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution,a reserve for crises should be established by applying, at the beginning ofeach year, a reduction to direct payments through a financial disciplinemechanism which is provided for in Article 26 of Regulation (EU)No 1306/2013 of 17 December 2013 of the European Parliament and of theCouncil on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agriculturalpolicy[1].Article 25 of this regulation determines that the total amount of the reservefor crises in agricultural sector shall be EUR 2 800 million with equalannual instalments of EUR 400 million (at 2011 prices) for the period 2014-2020and shall be included under Heading 2 of the Multiannual Financial Framework.The amount of the reserve to be included in the Commission 2016 Draft Budgetamounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices, covered via a reduction todirect payments listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing rulesfor direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework ofthe common agricultural policy[2].

Moreover, with a view to ensuring that theamounts for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) comply withthe annual sub-ceilings for market related expenditure and direct paymentsunder heading 2 laid down in Council Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 1311/2013 of 2December 2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years2014-2020[3],the financial discipline mechanism has to be applied when the forecasts for thefinancing of direct payments and market related expenditure indicate that theannual sub-ceiling under heading 2 set out in the Multiannual FinancialFramework adjusted by any financial transfers between the European AgriculturalGuarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development(EAFRD) will be exceeded. This net balance available for EAGF expenditure for2016 is set by the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2015/141[4] in accordance withArticle 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and amounts toEUR 43 949 million.

In drawing up the 2016 Draft Budget, thefirst budgetary estimates for direct payments and market related expenditureshowed that the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is notlikely to be exceeded and thus there is no need for further financialdiscipline.

On the basis of the above, the Commissionpresents a proposal for setting the adjustment rate for direct payments inrespect of calendar year 2015, which in accordance with Article 26(3) ofRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is to be adopted by the European Parliament andthe Council by 30 June 2015. If this adjustment rate has not been set by 30June 2015, pursuant to the same Article the Commission will set that rate.

2.           RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONSWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

This proposal implements the rules providedfor in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation(EU) No 1307/2013. Prior consultation with the interested parties andpreparation of an impact assessment were not applicable.

3.           LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THEPROPOSAL

This proposal sets the percentage rate ofthe financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015.

Considering that Member States have thepossibility to make late payments to farmers outside the regulatory paymentperiod applicable to direct payments and that the financial discipline adjustmentrate varies from one calendar year to another, the amounts of direct paymentsto be granted to farmers should not be affected by the financial disciplinedifferently, depending on when the payment is made to farmers by the MemberStates. Therefore, in order to ensure equal treatment between farmers, theadjustment rate should be applied to amounts of direct payments to be grantedto farmers for aid applications lodged in calendar year 2015 only,independently of when the payment will actually be made to the farmer.

Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments shouldonly apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000. Bulgaria, Croatia andRomania are in the process of phasing-in of direct payments in calendar year2015. As a consequence, the financial discipline will not apply in these MemberStates.

4.           BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

The calculation of the financial disciplineadjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget.

The amount of the reserve for crises in theagricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2016 DraftBudget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices. The first estimates ofbudget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure showedthat the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not likely tobe exceeded.

Thus the total reduction resulting from theapplication of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. Thepercentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%. It hasbeen calculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts ofdirect payments per farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 and not in all MemberStates.

The application of this adjustment ratewill result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget linescovering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers inrespect of calendar year 2015 (financial year 2016).

5.           OPTIONAL ELEMENTS

Further to determining the adjustment rateset by the present Regulation, Article 26(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013also gives the possibility to the Commission, on the basis of new informationin its possession, to adopt implementing acts adapting this rate. TheCommission will review its forecasts for market related expenditure and directpayments when preparing the Amending Letter to the 2016 Draft Budget in October2015, and adopt the adaptation of the adjustment rate, if appropriate by 1December 2015.

2015/0070 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

fixing the adjustment rate provided for inRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 for direct payments in respect of calendar year2015

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[5],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)       Article 25 of Regulation(EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[6]lays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for theagricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agriculturalproduction or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginningof each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial disciplinemechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation.

(2)       Article 26(1) ofRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013 lays down that in order to ensure that theannual ceilings set out in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013[7] for the financing ofthe market related expenditure and direct payments are respected, an adjustmentrate for direct payments has to be determined when the forecasts for thefinancing of the measures financed under that sub-ceiling for a given financialyear indicate that the applicable annual ceilings will be exceeded.

(3)       The amount of the reservefor crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in theCommission 2016 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices.To cover this amount, the financial discipline mechanism has to apply to directpayments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No1307/2013 of the European Parliamentand of the Council[8] in respect of calendar year 2015.

(4)       The preliminary forecastsfor the direct payments and market related expenditure to be determined in theCommission 2016 Draft Budget indicate that there is no need for any furtherfinancial discipline.

(5)       According to Article 26(2)of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 the Commission has to present a proposalto the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the adjustment rate nolater than 31 March of the calendar year in respect of which that adjustmentrate applies.

(6)       As a general rule, farmerssubmitting an aid application for direct payments for one calendar year (N) arepaid within a fixed payment period falling under the financial year (N+1).However, Member States have the possibility to make late payments, withincertain limits, to farmers beyond this payment period without any time limits.Such late payments may fall in a later financial year. When financialdiscipline is applied for a given calendar year, the adjustment rate should notbe applied to payments for which aid applications have been submitted in thecalendar years other than that for which the financial discipline applies.Therefore, in order to ensure equal treatment of farmers, it is appropriate toprovide that the adjustment rate is only applied to payments for which aidapplications have been submitted in the calendar year for which the financialdiscipline is applied, irrespectively of when the payment to farmers is made.

(7)       Article 8(1) of Regulation(EU) No 1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct paymentsdetermined in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 isonly to apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted tofarmers in the corresponding calendar year. Furthermore Article 8(2) ofRegulation (EU) No 1307/2013 providesthat as a result of the gradual introduction of direct payments, the adjustmentrate is only to apply to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and toCroatia from 1 January 2022. The adjustment rate to be determined by thepresent Regulation should therefore not apply to payments to farmers in thoseMember States.

(8)       Until 1 December 2015 theadjustment rate fixed by this Regulation may be adapted by the Commission, onthe basis of new information in its possession, pursuant to Article 26(4) ofRegulation (EU) No 1306/2013,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

1.           For the purpose ofapplying the adjustment provided for in Articles 25 and 26 of Regulation (EU)No 1306/2013 and inaccordance with Article 8(1)of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, the amounts of direct payments under the supportschemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 to be granted to afarmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respectof calendar year 2015 shall be reduced by 1.393041%.

2.           The reduction provided forin paragraph 1 shall not apply in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania.

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force onthe seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal ofthe European Union.

This Regulation shall be bindingin its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

OBSERVATIONS:   The calculation of the financial discipline adjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget. The amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2016 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices. Based on the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure, the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not likely to be exceeded. Thus the total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. The percentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%. It has been calculated taking into account that it is to be applied only to amounts in excess of EUR 2 000 and for each Member State, except Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. Since direct payments in Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, are in the process of phasing-in in calendar year 2015, the financial discipline will not apply to these Member States as a consequence. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2015 (financial year 2016). The estimated amounts of reduction due to financial discipline per budget item are the following:   05 03 01 02 (SAPS) 05 03 01 07 (Redistributive payment) 05 03 01 10 (BPS) 05 03 01 11 (Payment for agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment) 05 03 01 12 (Payment for areas with natural constraints) 05 03 01 13 (Payment for young farmers)   05 03 02 40 (Area aid for cotton) 05 03 02 50 (POSEI – Community support programmes) 05 03 02 52 (POSEI – Aegean Islands) 05 03 02 60 (Voluntary coupled support) 05 03 02 61 (Small farmers scheme)   Total || in EUR million 31.1 12.0           212.2            128.1    0.0  5.7           3.3           4.2 0.1 44.9          p.m.   441.6

The proposed regulation has budgetary implications as the first  estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments (before considering  financial discipline) have been reduced by the amounts shown above following  the application of the adjustment rate proposed by the present draft  regulation. As a result, the requested appropriations for Chapter 05 03  (Direct payments) and foreseen to be included in the 2016 Draft Budget, as  given in point 1 of this financial statement for the budget items subject to  financial discipline, ensure the establishment of the amount for the reserve  for agricultural crises.
