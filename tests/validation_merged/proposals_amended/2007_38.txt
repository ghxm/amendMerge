Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) by reason of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union

(presented by the Commission)

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council established a common classification of territorial units for statistics (referred to as the “NUTS”) for the Member States. The Regulation was amended due to the enlargement of EU with 10 new Member States in 2004 by amendment Regulation (EC) No 1888/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

Because of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, this proposed Regulation establishes the classification of the territorial units for community statistics for these new Member States.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) by reason of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 (1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1],

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [2],

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3],

Whereas:

(1) Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 ( [4]) constitutes the legal framework for the regional classification in order to enable the collection, compilation and dissemination of harmonised regional statistics in the Community.

(2) All Member States’ statistics transmitted to the Commission, which are broken down by territorial units, should use the NUTS classification, where applicable.

(3) It is necessary to adapt the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 to take into account the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union.

(4) Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,

(4 a) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 is amended as follows:

1. Annex I is amended in accordance with the text shown in Annex I to this Regulation.

2. Annex II is amended in accordance with the text shown in Annex II to this Regulation.

3. Annex III is amended in accordance with the text shown in Annex III to this Regulation.

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Done at Brussels,

For the European Parliament For the Council

The President The President
