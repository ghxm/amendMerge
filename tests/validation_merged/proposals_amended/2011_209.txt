Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 as regards certain provisions relating to financial management for certain Members States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability /* COM/2011/0481 final - 2011/0209 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           backgroundto the proposal

·      Reasons and objectives for the proposal

The sustained financial and economic crisis isincreasing the pressure on national financial resources, as Member States arereducing their budgets. In this context ensuring a smooth implementation ofrural development programmes is of particular importance as a tool forproviding financial assistance to the real economy.

Nonetheless, the implementation of theprogrammes is often challenging as a result of the liquidity problems resultingfrom budget constraints. This is particularly the case for those Member Stateswhich have been most affected by the crisis and have received financialassistance under a programme from the Balance of Payments (BoP) mechanism fornon EURO countries or from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism(EFSM) for the EURO countries. To date, six countries have requested financialassistance under these mechanisms and have agreed with the Commission amacro-economic adjustment programme. Hungary has received financial assistancefrom 2009 but has exited the support mechanism in 2010. The remaining fivecountries are Romania and Latvia under the BoP and Portugal, Greece, andIreland under the EFSM, hereafter called "programme countries.

In order to help these Member States tocontinue the implementation of the programmes on the ground and disburse fundsto projects, the current proposal contains provisions that allow the EAFRDcontribution rate applicable to the rural development programmes of these MS tobe increased up to a maximumof 95% of eligible public expenditure in the regionseligible under the Convergence objective, the outermost regions and the smallerAegean Islands and 85% of eligible public expenditure in other regions as longas they are under the support mechanisms. This will provide additionalfinancial resources to the Member States and will facilitate the continuationof the implementation of the programmes on the ground.

·     General context

The deepening of the financial crisis in someof the Member States is undoubtedly affecting substantially the real economydue to the amount of debt and the difficulties encountered by the Governmentsto borrow money from the market.

The Commission has been very active in puttingforward proposals on how best to react to the current financial crisis and toits socio-economic consequences. In particular in the framework of its recoverypackage, the Commission proposed in December 2008 a number of regulatorychanges to increase the EAFRD contribution rate applicable to the expenditureincurred by the rural development programmes within the year 2009. Greece,Latvia and Hungary among the countries above indicated, benefited of thisfacility.

·     Provisions in force in the policy sphere ofthe proposal

Council Regulation (CE) No 1698/2005 on supportfor rural development by the European agriculture Fund for Rural Development(EAFRD) defines the common rules applicable to the programming process as wellas arrangements for programme management, monitoring, and evaluation ofprojects.

Rural development programmes shall bere-examined and adapted for the remainder of the programming period, in casethis would be neccesary to ensure consistency with the Community strategicguidelines, the national strategy plan and Regulation (CE) No 1698/2005, inline with Articles 18 and 19 of that Regulation.

Article 26(1) of Council Regulation (EC) 1290/2005provides that the interim payments shall be calculated by applying theco-financing rate for each priority to the certified public expenditurepertaining to it.

·     Consistency with other policies andobjectives of the Union

Not applicable.

2.           CONSULTATION OF INTEREST PARTIES ANDIMPACT ANALYSIS

·     Consultation of interested parties

The proposal is consistent with other proposalsand intitiatives adopted by the European Commission as a response to thefinancial crisis .

·     Procurement and use of expertise

Use of external expertise has not beennecessary.

·     Impact analysis

The proposal will allow the Commission toapprove higher EAFRD contribution rates for the countries concerned, for aslong as they are under the support mechanisms.

There is no need for an additional budget asthe total financial allocation from the Funds for the countries and theprogrammes over the 2007-2013 programming period will not change.

3.           Legal elements of the proposal

·     Summary of the proposal

·      It is proposed to modify article 70 of Council Regulation 1698/2005in order to allow the EAFRD contribution rate applicable to the ruraldevelopment programmes of the MS concerned to be increased up to 95% ofeligible public expenditure in the regions eligible under the Convergenceobjective, the outermost regions and the smaller Aegean Islands and 85% ofeligible public expenditure in other regions, for as long as they are under thesupport mechanisms.

Following the adoption of a Council decisiongranting assistance to a Member State under the support mechanisms, the MS willsubmit to the Commission a proposal of modification of its rural developmentprogramme increasing the EAFRD co-financing rates. Payments submitted afterapproval of this modification will benefit of the higher support. This will bea temporary measure which will be terminated once the Member State exits thesupport mechanism.

In accordance with the general principlesapplicable under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, theincreased co-financing rates may only apply for payments to be made after therespective rural development programmes, including the new financial plans,have been approved by the Commission.

·     Legal basis

Council Regulation (CE) No 1698/2005 of 20September 2005 on support for rural development by the European agricultureFund for Rural Development (EAFRD) defines the common rules applicable to theprogramming process as well as arrangements for programme management,monitoring, and evaluation of projects. The proposal to modify Regulation (CE)No 1698/2005 should be based on Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union.

·     Subsidiarity principle

The proposal complies within the subsidiarityprinciple to the extent that it seeks to provide increased support through theEAFRD for certain Member States which experience serious difficulties or arethreatened with such difficulties notably with problems in their economicgrowth and financial stability and with a deterioration in their deficit anddebt position, also due to the international economic and financialenvironment. In this context, it is necessary to establish at the EuropeanUnion level a temporary mechanism which allows the European Commission toreimburse certified expenditure under the EAFRD, using a higher co-financingrate.

·     Proportionality principle

The proposal conforms to the proportionalityprinciple:

The current proposal is indeed proportionatesince it goes a long way in providing increased support from the EAFRD to theMember States in difficulties or threatened with severe difficulties caused byexceptional occurrences going beyond its control and falling under theconditions of Council Regulation (EU) 407/2010 (establishing the Europeanfinancial stabilization mechanism), or in difficulties or seriously threatenedwith difficulties as regards its balance of payments and falling under theconditions of Council Regulation (EC) 332/2002. For Greece, the Inter-creditorAgreement concluded together with the Euro Area Loan Facility Act entered intoforce on 11 May 2010. It foresees that the availability period would expire onthe third anniversary of the date of the agreement.

·     Choice of instruments

Proposed instrument: regulation.

Other instruments would not be appropriate forthe following reasons:

The Commission has explored the scope formanoeuvre provided by the legal framework and considers necessary, in the lightof the experience up to now, to propose modifications to the Council Regulation1698/2005. The objective of this revision is to further facilitate theco-financing of projects thereby accelerating both their implementation and theimpact of such investments on the real economy.

4.           Budgetary impact

There is no impact on commitment appropriationssince no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of EAFRD financingprovided for in the Operational Programmes for the programming period2007-2013. For the period in question, the Commission will be reimbursingcertified expenditure at a higher co-financing rate. This will immediatelytranslate in additional payments to the Member States concerned for theexpenditure declared to the Commission from the date of entry into force ofthis Regulation, following the revision of the rural development programmes.

On the basis of the forecasts of expendituresent to the Commission to date by the Member States concerned, an additionalEUR 90 million from the 2011 budget if the proposal is approved in time, andEUR 470 million from the 2012 budget might be necessary to be paid out in casethe Member States decide to use the maximum co-finance rate allowed.

In the light of Member State's request tobenefit from the action and taking into account the evolution in regard to thesubmission of interim payments, the Commission will in 2012 review the need foradditional payment appropriations and if necessary propose the relevant actionsto the Budgetary Authority.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Council Regulation (EC) No1698/2005 as regards certain provisions relating to financial management forcertain Members States experiencing or threatened with serious difficultieswith respect to their financial stability

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, 43 andthereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the EuropeanCommission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure

Whereas:

(1)              The unprecedented global financial crisis andeconomic downturn have seriously damanged economic growth and financialstability and provoked a strong deterioration of financial and economicconditions of several Member States. In particular, certain Member Statesexperience serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties,notably with problems in their economic growth and financial stability and witha deterioration in their deficit and debt position, also due to theinternational economic and financial environment.

(2)              Whilst important actions to counterbalance thenegative effects of the crisis have already been taken, including amendments ofthe legislative framework, the impact of the financial crisis on the realeconomy, the labour market and the citizens is being widely felt. The pressureon national financial resources is increasing and further steps should be takento alleviate that pressure through the maximum and optimal use of the fundingfrom the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (hereinafter the"EAFRD").

(3)              Based on Article 122(2) of the Treaty providing thepossibility of granting Union financial assistance to a Member State indifficulties or seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused byexceptional occurences beyond its control, Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010of 11 May 2010 establishing a European financial stabilisationmechanism[3]has established such mechanism with a view to preserving the financialstability of the Union.

(4)              By Council Implementing Decisions 2011/77/EU of7 December 2010[4]and 2011/344/EU of 30 May 2011[5]Ireland and Portugal were granted such Union financial assistance. Greece wasexperiencing serious difficulties with respect to its financial stabilitybefore the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 and receivedfinancial assistance inter alia from other euro area Member States.

(5)              Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 of 18 February2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance forMember States' balances of payments[6]has established an instrument providing that theCouncil will grant mutual assistance where a Member State which has not adoptedthe euro is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties asregards its balance of payments.

(6)              By Council Decisions 2009/102/EC of 4 November 2008[7], 2009/290/EC of 20 January 2009[8] and 2009/459/EC of 26 June 2009[9] Hungary, Latvia and Romaniawere granted such financial assistance.

(7)              The period during which the assistance isavailable to Ireland, Hungary, Latvia, Portugal and Romania is set out in therespective Council Decisions. Assistance to Hungary expired on 4 November 2010.

(8)              For Greece, theInter-creditor Agreement concluded together with theEuro Area Loan Facility Act entered into force on 11 May 2010. It foresees thatthe availability period would expire on the third anniversary of the date ofthe agreement.

(9)              On 11 July 2011, finance ministers of the 17euro-area Member States signed the Treaty establishing the European StabilityMechanism (ESM). The Treaty follows the European Council decision of 25 March2011. It is foreseen that by 2013, the ESM will assume the tasks currentlyfulfilled by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the EuropeanFinancial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM).

(10)          The European Council conclusions of 23 and 24July 2011 welcome the Commission's intention to enhance the synergies betweenthe loan programme for Greece and the Union funds, supporting efforts toincrease Greece's capacity to absorb Union funds in order to stimulate growthand employment by refocusing on improving competitiveness and employmentcreation. Moreover, the conclusions welcome and support the preparation by theCommission, together with the Member States, of a comprehensive programme oftechnical assistance to Greece. This Regulation contributes to these synergyefforts.

(11)          In order to facilitate the management of Unionfunding, to help accelerate the investments in Member States and regionsconcerned and to increase the impact of the funding on the economy it isnecessary to allow the increase of the EAFRD contribution rate up to a 95% of eligible public expenditure in the regions eligible under theConvergence objective and 85% of eligible public expenditure in other regions which are facing serious difficulties with respect to their financialstability.

(12)          In accordance with the general principlesapplicable under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, theincreased co-financing rates may only apply for payments to be made after therespective rural development programmes, including the new financial plans,have been approved by the Commission. It is therefore alsonecessary to determine the procedure under which theMember States may use that possibility as well as the mechanism through whichit will be ensured.

(12a) This temporary increase in co-financing rates should also be considered in the context of the budgetary restraints facing all Member States and those budgetary restraints should be reflected appropriately in the Union budget. In addition, since the main purpose of the mechanism is to address specific current difficulties, its application should be limited to expenditure incurred by the paying agencies until 31 December 2013;

(13)          Council Regulation(EC) No 1698/2005 of 11 July 2006 on support for ruraldevelopment by the Agricultural Fund for Rural development EAFRD,[10]should therefore be amended accordingly.

(13a) Due to the urgent need to address the economic crisis, this Regulation should enter into force immediately on publication;

6.4 || OTHER ||

OBSERVATIONS: (1) As regards commitment appropriations, the modification of Regulation 1698/2005 will not have any financial impact as the global envelope for rural development remains unchanged as well as its annual breakdown. For payments, the increase of the co-financing rate can result in higher reimbursements to the MS concerned. In the event that the proposal is approved in time to apply the new rate to the payment requests relating to the third quarter 2011, the additional payment appropriations necessary in this year can be estimated at EUR 90 million. For 2011, the situation if needed will be handled in the Global Transfer. The estimate of additional payments to be made in 2012 amounts to EUR 470 million. In the light of Member State's requests to benefit from the action and taking into account the evolution regarding the submission of interim payments, the Commission will in 2012 review the need for additional payment appropriations and if necessary propose the relevant actions to the Budgetary Authority. No estimate has been calculated for year 2013 since, in the event that exceptional circumstances continue to justify increased co-financing rates, the consequences would be taken into account in the budget procedure. As the total envelope of the EARDF does not change, additional payments in 2011 and 2012 will lead to an equivalent reduction of payments at the end of the period
