Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 2009/138/EC on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) as regards the dates of its transposition and application and the date of repeal of certain Directives /* COM/2012/0217 final - 2012/0110 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

1.1.        Grounds for and objectivesof the proposal

Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II) provides amodern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of Europeaninsurance and reinsurance undertakings. These new rules are essential in orderto ensure a safe and solid insurance sector that can provide sustainableinsurance products and support the real economy through long-term investmentsand additional stability.

The deadline for transposition of Directive2009/138/EC is 31 October 2012. The existing insurance and reinsurancedirectives (Directives 64/225/EEC, 73/239/EEC, 73/240/EEC, 76/580/EEC,78/473/EEC, 84/641/EEC, 87/344/EEC, 88/357/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 98/78/EC,2001/17/EC, 2002/83/EC and 2005/68/EC, as amended by the acts listed in Part Aof Annex VI) that are collectively referred to as Solvency I will be repealedwith effect from 1 November 2012.

On 19 January 2011 the Commission adopted aproposal to amend Directive 2009/138/EC in order to take into account the newsupervisory architecture for insurance and namely the setting-up of theEuropean Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) on 1 January2011 (COM (2011) 8, COD 2011/0006)(Omnibus II). The proposal also includedprovisions to extend the transposition, repeal and application dates inDirective 2009/138/EC. These rules are essential in order to ensure a smoothtransition to the new regime. In addition and in order to become fullyoperational, the Solvency II-regime also requires a high number of delegatedand implementing acts by the Commission, providing important details ondifferent technical matters. Many of these so-called "level 2"-rulesare closely linked to the Omnibus II-Directive and cannot be presented by theCommission before the publication of Omnibus II.

At the current stage, there is a risk that theproposed Omnibus II Directive will not be published and will not have enteredinto force before the deadline for transposition of Directive 2009/138/ECexpires at 31 October 2012. Leaving this date unchanged would imply that theFramework Directive would need to be implemented without the transitional rulesand other important adaptations foreseen in Omnibus II. In order to avoid thissituation and ensure the legal continuity of the current Solvency provisions(Solvency I) until the complete Solvency II-package is in place, it is proposedthat the relevant transposition date in Directive 2009/138/EC is extended to 30June 2013.

It is important to allow supervisors and (re)insuranceundertakings some time to prepare for the application of Solvency II. It istherefore proposed to set the date for first application of Solvency II at 1January 2014. This will make it possible to timely start the supervisoryapproval procedures e g for internal models and undertaking specificparameters.

The date of repeal of Solvency I should beamended accordingly.

In view of the above and given the very shortperiod of time left before the time limit of 31 October 2012, this Directiveshould be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council as a matter ofurgency and enter into force without delay.

This Directive is necessary in order to preventa legal vacuum to arise after 31 October 2012.

A gap would exist between the EU legal system (SolvencyII) and that of Member States (where Solvency I as transposed would remain inforce). This would lead to legal uncertainty for supervisors, undertakings andMember States.

1.2.        Directive 2009/138/EC(Solvency II)

This Directive establishes a new and modernsolvency regime for insurers and reinsurers in the European Union. It providesfor an economic risk-based approach which provides incentives for insurance andreinsurance undertakings to properly measure and manage their risks.

1.3.        Proposal COM (2011) 8 (theOmnibus II Directive)

This proposal aims to amend Directive2009/138/EC in order to adapt Solvency II to the new supervisory architecturefor insurance and namely the setting-up of the European Insurance andOccupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) on 1 January 2011 (COM (2011) 8, COD2011/0006). It proposes to postpone the transposition deadline of Solvency IIto 31 December 2012.

2.           RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THEINTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

2.1.        Transmission of thisproposal to the national parliaments

Draft legislative acts, including proposalsfrom the Commission, sent to the European Parliament and to the Council must beforwarded to national parliaments in accordance with the Protocol (No 1) on therole of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaties.

According to Article 4 of the Protocol, aneight-week period must elapse between a draft legislative act being madeavailable to national parliaments and the date when it is placed on aprovisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of aposition under a legislative procedure.

However, exceptions are possible under Article4 in cases of urgency, the reasons for which must be stated in the act orposition of the Council. The adoption of this proposal by the EuropeanParliament and the Council has to be considered as a case of absolute urgencyfor the reasons explained above.

2.2.        Impact assessment

This proposal is not accompanied by a separateImpact Assessment as an impact assessment for the Solvency II Directive hasalready been undertaken and this proposal only aims at avoiding a situation oflegal vacuum to arise because of the late publication of Omnibus II in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.

Doing nothing at this stage would create a veryuncertain legal situation after 31 October 2012. A gap would exist between theEU legal system (Solvency II) and that of Member States (where Solvency I astransposed would remain in force). This would lead to legal uncertainty for supervisors,undertakings and Member States.

Furthermore the Framework Directive would needto be implemented without the transitional rules and other importantadaptations foreseen in Omnibus II.

The proposed amendment affects only theobligation on Member States to transpose the Directive by 31 October 2012,extending it to 30 June 2013. It also foresees a date of first application of 1January 2014. It does not alter the substance of the Directive in question anddoes not therefore impose any additional obligations on businesses.

3.           LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL

3.1.        Summary of the proposedmeasures

The proposal amends Article 309(1) of Directive2009/138/EC by postponing the date of transposition to 30 June 2013 andsetting-up a later date for its application (1 January 2014). It also amendsArticles 310 and 311 accordingly by setting-up a new date for the repeal ofSolvency I (1 January 2014).

3.2.        Legal basis

Articles 53 (1) and 62 of the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union.

3.3.        Subsidiarity principle

The subsidiarity principle applies as theproposal concerns a field which does not fall within the exclusive competenceof the European Union.

The objectives of the proposal cannot beachieved sufficiently by the Member States, as the provisions of directivescannot be amended or repealed at national level.

The objectives of the proposal can be achievedonly by EU action, as this proposal amends an act of EU law which is in force,and this is something which cannot be done by the Member States themselves.

The principle of subsidiarity is complied within that the proposal amends existing EU legislation.

3.4.        Proportionality principle

The proposal complies with the proportionalityprinciple for the following reason.

It does not alter the substance of the currentEU legislation: it is restricted to postponing the date for the transpositionof Directive 2009/138/EC until 30 June 2013; in order to avoid a situation oflegal uncertainty after the current deadline for transposition (31 October2012) has expired. It also provides for a new, later application date forSolvency II and consequent repeal of Solvency I (1 January 2014).

3.5.        Choice of instruments

Proposed instrument(s): directive.

No other instrument would have been suitable.As this is an amended directive, the only way forward is to adopt anotherdirective.

4.           BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

The proposal has no implication for the EUbudget.

5.           OPTIONAL ELEMENTS

·              Simplification

·              Repeal of existing legislation

The adoption of the proposal will not in itselfentail the repeal of existing legislation; it merely adjusts the date of therepeal already foreseen in Directive 2009/138/EC.

·              European Economic Area

This draft instrument is concerned with asubject covered by the EEA Agreement and must therefore be extended to coverthe European Economic Area.

2012/0110 (COD)

Proposal for a

DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Directive 2009/138/EC on thetaking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)as regards the dates of its transposition and application and the date ofrepeal of certain Directives

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 53(1) andArticle 62 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[1],

Having regard to the opinion of theCommittee of the Regions[2],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)       Directive2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009on the taking up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance(Solvency II)[3]provides a modern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision ofEuropean insurance and reinsurance undertakings. These new rules are essentialin order to ensure a safe and solid insurance sector that can providesustainable insurance products and support the real economy through long-terminvestments and additional stability.

(2)       Directive2009/138/EC sets 31 October 2012 as the the date for transposition and 1 November2012 as the date of repeal of . the existing insurance and reinsurance Directives(Directives 64/225/EEC[4],73/239/EEC[5],73/240/EEC[6],76/580/EEC[7],78/473/EEC[8],84/641/EEC[9],87/344/EEC[10],88/357/EEC[11],92/49/EEC[12],98/78/EC[13],2001/17/EC[14],2002/83/EC[15]and 2005/68/EC[16].

(3)       On19 January 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal to amend Directive2009/138/EC[17]in order to take into account the new supervisory architecture for insuranceand namely the setting-up of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority(EIOPA). (Omnibus II). That proposal also included provisions to extend thetransposition, repeal and application dates set out in Directive 2009/138/EC.

(4)       Giventhe complexity of the "Omnibus II" proposal, there is a risk that itwill not have entered into force before the relevant dates set out in Directive2009/138/EC. Leaving those dates unchanged would result in Directive2009/138/EC to be implemented without the important adaptations provided in"Omnibus II" being put in place.

(5)       Inorder to avoid overly burdensome legislative obligations for Member Statesunder Directive 2009/138/EC and later on under the new architecture envisagedby the "Omnibus II" proposal, it is appropriate to extend thetransposition deadline for Directive 2009/138/EC.

(6)       Inorder to allow for supervisors and insurance and reinsurance undertakings toprepare for the application of the new architecture as a whole, a later date ofapplication, namely 1 January 2014, should be foreseen.

(7)       Inorder to avoid a legal vacuum, the date of repeal of the existing insuranceDirectives should therefore be aligned accordingly.

(8)       Giventhe very short period of time left before the expiry of the deadlines laid downin Directive 2009/138/EC, this Directive should enter into force without delay.

(9)       Consequently,it is also justified to apply the exception for urgent cases provided for inArticle 4 of Protocol (No 1) on the role of national Parliaments in theEuropean Union in this case as regards the transmission to national Parliamentsof the proposal for this Directive,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
