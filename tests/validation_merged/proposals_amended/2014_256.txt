Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency /* COM/2014/0557 final - 2014/0256 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

Justification and objectives

Following the proposal that will repeal andreplace Directive 2001/82/EC on veterinary medicinal products, Regulation (EC)No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation andsupervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishinga European Medicines Agency must be amended to take account of the fact thatcentralised marketing authorisation for veterinary products is being decoupled fromthat for medicines for humans.

Legal basis

The legal basis for legislative measures onanimal health, which are essential to public and animal health, environmentalprotection, trade and single market policy are:

·                        Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning ofthe European Union (TFEU), which provides for the establishment and functioningof the internal market and the approximation of relevant legal, regulatory andadministrative provisions; and

·                        Article 168(4)(c) TFEU, which covers measures settinghigh standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and devices formedical uses.

2.           RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONSWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

Better regulation of veterinarypharmaceuticals: how to put in place a simpler legal framework, safeguardingpublic and animal health while increasing the competitiveness of companies, a public consultation on the key issues of the envisaged legalproposal, was launched on the Commission’s website on 13 April 2010 and wasavailable through the interactive policy-making (IPM) tool until 15 July2010.[1]

The consultation and a study, Anassessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceuticallegislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for theCommission between November 2009 and June 2011.[2]

The Commission’s Impact Assessment Board(IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013.

3.           LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THEPROPOSAL

Provisions regarding granting andmaintaining marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products aredeleted from Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The rules on marketing authorisationsvalid in all EU Member States are part of the proposal for a Regulation onveterinary medicinal products. The new Regulation on veterinary medicinalproducts will cover all routes granting marketing authorisations for veterinarymedicinal products in the Union – both at centralised and national level.

The costs of the procedures and servicesassociated with the operation of this Regulation need to be recovered from thosemaking medicinal products available on the market and from those seekingauthorisation. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish certain principlesapplicable to fees payable to the Agency, including the need to take intoaccount, as appropriate, the specific needs for SMEs. The provisions regulatingfees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon.

As a consequence of the entry into force ofthe Treaty of Lisbon, the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation(EC) No 726/2004 should be aligned to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union. In order to supplement or amend certainnon-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the power to adopt actsin accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to theCommission in respect of amending the Annex totechnical and scientific progress, determining the situations in whichpost-authorisation efficacy studies may be required, laying down provisions andrequirements for granting marketing authorisations subject to certain specificobligations, establishing procedures for the examination of applications forvariations to the terms of marketing authorisations and for the examination ofapplications for the transfer of marketing authorisations and laying down theprocedure for investigating the infringements and the imposition of fines orperiodic penalty payments to the holders of marketing authorisations grantedunder this Regulation, the maximum amounts of these penalties as well as theconditions and methods for their collection.

The entry into force and application ofthis Regulation should be on the same date as of the new Regulation onveterinary medicinal products.

4.           BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

It is planned that the costs for the EMA forimplementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged toindustry.

Therefore, the proposal is not expected tohave any financial impact on the budget of the EU.

As set out in the legislative financialstatement the additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plusexpenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc.

The level of fees, their structure andmodalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by wayof implementing acts. This holds not only for the fees for new tasks for theEMA set out in this proposal, but for all fees in general.

2014/0256 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Regulation (EC) No 726/2004laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision ofmedicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a EuropeanMedicines Agency

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and Article168(4)(c) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[3],

Having regard to the opinion of theCommittee of the Regions[4],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)       Directive 2001/82/EC ofthe European Parliament and of the Council[5]and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council[6] constituted the Unionregulatory framework for the manufacture, authorisation and distribution ofveterinary medicinal products. In the light of the experience acquired andfollowing the assessment by the Commission of the functioning of the internal marketfor veterinary medicinal products, the regulatory framework for veterinarymedicinal products has been reviewed, and Regulation (EU) No […] of the EuropeanParliament and of the Council[7]laying down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of veterinarymedicinal products has been adopted.

(2)       Regulation (EU) No […]also provides for centralised marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinalproducts. The parts of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 relating to procedures forthose marketing authorisation should therefore be repealed.

(3)       The costs of theprocedures and services associated with the operation of this Regulation needto be recovered from those making medicinal products available on the marketand from those seeking authorisation. It is appropriate to establish certainprinciples applicable to fees payable to the Agency, including the need to takeinto account, as appropriate, the specific needs for SMEs. The provisionsregulating fees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon.

(4)       As a consequence of theentry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the powers conferred on theCommission under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 should be aligned to Articles 290and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union In order tosupplement or amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No726/2004, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treatyshould be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendingthe Annex to technical and scientific progress, determining the situations inwhich post-authorisation efficacy studies may be required, laying downprovisions and requirements for granting marketing authorisations subject tocertain specific obligations, establishing procedures for the examination ofapplications for variations to the terms of marketing authorisations and forthe examination of applications for the transfer of marketing authorisationsand laying down the procedure for investigating the infringements and theimposition of fines or periodic penalty payments to the holders of marketingauthorisations granted under this Regulation, the maximum amounts of thesepenalties as well as the conditions and methods for their collection.

(5)       It is of particularimportance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during itspreparation of delegated acts, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegatedacts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission ofrelevant documents to the European Parliament and Council.

(6)       In order to ensure uniformconditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, implementingpowers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing acts inrelation to marketing authorisations for medicinal products for human use.Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011of the European Parliament and of the Council[8].

(7)       Regulation (EC) No726/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,
