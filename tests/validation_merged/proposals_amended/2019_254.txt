Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

laying down certain transitional provisions for the support by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in the year 2021 and amending Regulations (EU) No 228/2013, (EU) No 229/2013 and (EU) No 1308/2013 as regards resources and their distribution in respect of the year 2021 and amending Regulations  (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 as regards their resources and application in the year 2021

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

•

Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

(a)

Extension of the applicability of the existing regulations

The Commission’s r

eform proposals

1

on the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020

provide that the Member States start to implement their Strategic Plans as from 1 January 2021. This would imply that Member States submit their Strategic Plans

at the latest

by 1 January 2020 and that the Commission approves these plans in the course of the year. In view of the present state of play in both the Parliament and the Council, it is clear that the basic acts and the ensuing delegated and implementing acts will not be formally adopted by January 2020 and that, therefore, it will be necessary to plan for a transitional period.

This transitional period will require the extension of the applicability of the existing legal framework and adaptations of certain rules to ensure the continuity of the CAP until the new system is in place.

Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013, 1306/2013, 1307/2013 and 1308/2013 are formally not limited in time and, therefore, will continue to apply until they are repealed. Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 will continue to apply to the support approved by the Commission under Regulation 1305/2013.

However, the Direct Payments Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 and the Rural Development Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 do not contain the amount of Union support or national ceilings for the years after 2020. This is also true for Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union and Regulation (EU) No 229/2013 on specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands. These Regulations will therefore become in practice inapplicable as of 2021. Therefore, they need to be amended to include the relevant amounts/ceilings, when they are decided for the new MFF 2021-2027. Furthermore, in the Direct Payments Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 certain rules were limited to the period until 2019. Regulation (EU) 2019/288 amending the Direct Payments Regulation provides for rules for calendar year 2020. These rules will need to be extended another time for the transitional period. For the sake of clarity and legal certainty, certain rules also need to be added or certain existing rules need to be amended to ensure continuity.

Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 provides rules in relation to the 2014-2020 programming. As the current programming period in rural development will have to be extended beyond this period, certain regulatory deadlines defined in that regulation will need to be adjusted accordingly.

The provisions on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 continue to apply, but certain modifications should be made to ensure continuity in the transitional period.

This proposal aims at providing certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers and ensuring the continuity of support for rural development in the transitional period for those Member States that have used their 2014-2010 EAFRD allocations by extending the current legal framework until the new CAP becomes applicable. In order to allow Member States to make the necessary adaptations at national level, these changes would need to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament by mid-2020.

(b)

Transition to the next CAP period

The new CAP comes with significant changes. Transitional rules are needed to ensure a smooth transition from the current to the next CAP period.

As for the second pillar, the definition of transitional rules between the two programming periods represents a standard practice. Transitional rules are generally needed to bridge two consecutive programming periods. In view of the significant changes that come with the Commission’s reform proposals, there is all the more the need for transitional arrangements, in particular concerning the continuation of multiannual commitments undertaken in the current and previous programming periods.

The Single CMO Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, including aid schemes for specific sectors. It sets out the parameters for intervening on agricultural markets and providing sector-specific support. To ensure coherence, most interventions of the new CAP will be part of one strategic CAP support plan per Member State, including several sectorial interventions that have previously been set out in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Under the current rules, the different sectoral programmes follow different time frames. To ensure coherence, continuity and a smooth transition between the aid schemes under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the sectoral types of interventions under the new CAP it is necessary to set rules regarding the duration of each of these aid schemes with respect to the entry into application of the Member States’ CAP Strategic Plans. For aid schemes in the fruit and vegetables sector and in the olive oil and table olives sector, it is necessary to regulate the continuation and modification of operational programmes and work programmes.

•

Consistency with existing policy provisions in the

policy area

The proposed amendments are consistent with the existing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013, 1307/2013 and 1308/2013, therefore the proposal is consistent with the existing policy provisions of the CAP.

•

Consistency with other Union

policies

The proposed amendments are consistent with the proposal for

a

R

down

the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027

(MFF)

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

•

Legal basis

Articles 43(2) and Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

•

Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)

The TFEU provides that the competence for agriculture is shared between the Union and the Member States. The Union exercises its competence through the adoption of various legislative acts, thereby defining and implementing an EU common agricultural policy as provided for in Article 38 to 44 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The aim of this proposal is to bridge the period until the new CAP becomes applicable by extending the current legal framework and to ensure a smooth transition from the current to the next CAP period. These objectives can only be achieved through an amendment of Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013, No 1306/2013, No 1307/2013, No 1308/2013, No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 as well as by laying down certain transitional provisions.

•

Proportionality

The proposal does not entail any new policy developments compared to the legislative acts it intends to amend and the legislative framework it intends to transition into. The proposal modifies the existing Regulations only to the extent necessary to achieve the objectives outlined above.

•

Choice

of the instrument

Since the original legislative acts are regulations of the European Parliament and the Council, the amendments must also be introduced as a European Parliament and Council regulation by means of the ordinary legislative procedure.

3.

RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

•

Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation

Not applicable.

•

Stakeholder consultations

Not applicable.

•

Collection and use of expertise

Not applicable.

•

Impact assessment

The proposal addresses legal needs that follow from the late application of the new CAP due to the state of play of the discussions between the Institutions regarding the CAP reform. Without such legislation, farmers and other beneficiaries of the CAP risk not receiving support in 2021. This is why Member States are requesting the Commission to propose such legislation. It also proposes transitional adjustments that are necessary due to the significant changes that come with the Commission’s reform proposals. In this context, an impact assessment is not pertinent.

•

Regulatory fitness and simplification

Not applicable.

•

Fundamental rights

The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

4.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

The current Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 on rural development and (EU) No 1307/2013 on direct payments do not lay down allocations for the transitional period (beyond calendar year 2020). Therefore, the initiative has a budgetary impact in the sense that it adds the allocations for direct payments and rural development for the relevant transitional period to ensure smooth continuity. These allocations are equal to those in the CAP Plan proposal and they are coherent with the Commission’s proposal on the MFF 2021-2027. Where Member States do not decide to prolong their current rural development programmes, the 2021 EAFRD allocations will be transferred to the 2022 – 2025 EAFRD allocations.

Similarly, for the transitional period, the allocations contained in Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 need to be adjusted to respect the overall amounts for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) included in the MFF proposal.

The reserve for agricultural crises referred to in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is proposed to be maintained throughout the transitional period to ensure continuity. It is to be financed through financial discipline applied on direct payments. As such, it does not entail any additional expenditure.

The present proposal is neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments. The impact as regards the estimated schedule for payment appropriations will depend on Member States decisions as regards the prolongation of the current rural development programmes.

Similarly, any decision of Member States to transfer funds between direct payments and rural development will be neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments but may have an impact in terms of timing of payments that however cannot be estimated.

Further details on the financial implications of the present proposal are provided in the financial statement attached to the proposal.

Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal

The proposal concerns seven regulations:

·

Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of

the European Parliament and of the

Council laying down common provisions

on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (hereinafter: CPR)

·

Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the

Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (hereinafter: RD Regulation)

·

Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (hereinafter: Horizontal Regulation)

·

Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament a

nd of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes wit

h

in the framework of the

common agricultural policy (hereinafter: DP Regulation)

·

Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013

of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (hereinafter: CMO Regulation)

·

Regulation (EU) No

228/2013

of the European Parliament and of the Council

laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006

·

Regulation (EU) No

229/2013

of the European Parliament and of the Council

laying down specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006

The proposal is divided in two titles.

The first title includes four chapters, covering provisions extending the current legal framework to bridge the additional period until the CAP Plan is applicable and specific transitional provisions to ensure a smooth transition from the current to the next CAP period.

The second title mainly covers provisions extending the current legal framework.

Title I sets new stand-alone provisions.

Title II amends existing provisions.

Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 (CPR)

It is necessary that Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, laying down common rules for several funds including the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), continues to apply to programmes supported by the EAFRD for the 2014–2020 programming period as well as to those programmes supported by the EAFRD which Member States decide to extend for the transitional period. In this regard, certain regulatory deadlines need to be adapted to cover the transitional period.

Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013

The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 concern the optional extension of the current programming period 2014-2020 for a year. They include the relevant amounts of Union support for the extended period after 2020 in line with the Commission’s proposal on the MFF 2021-2027.

This proposal also ensures that multi-annual commitments from the current programming period (Art. 28, 29 and 33) can be continued into the new programming period. Member States will have to determine a shorter period for new commitments.

Moreover, it ensures the continued financing of commitments based on current as well as previous rules with the EAFRD financial envelopes of the next period.

Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013

The main adjustment concerns the reserve for agricultural crises referred to in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 which is proposed to be maintained throughout the transitional period to ensure continuity. The proposal also addresses certain regulatory deadlines that need to be adapted to cover the transitional period.

Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013

The Regulation currently includes national and net ceilings for direct payments up to calendar year 2020 included. Therefore, ceilings should be added for calendar year 2021 and the reference amounts for the crop-specific payment for cotton for calendar year 2021 should also be adapted. The proposal also aims to address errors made by Member States in the allocation of payment entitlements, regarding both the number and value of payment entitlements. In the interest of legal certainty, payment entitlements should be regularised from 2021.The proposal includes the possibility for Member States to continue transferring funds between pillars after calendar year 2020. It also renders the option for Member States to continue the internal convergence process after 2019, explicit. It provides for a prolongation of SAPS in the transitional period.

Regulation (EU) 1308/2013

The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 adjust the amounts of Union support for specific aid schemes for the transitional period in line with the Commission proposal for the MFF 2021-2027. They also lay down rules on the duration of each of these aid schemes with respect to the entry into application of the Member States’ future CAP Strategic Plans and for aid schemes in certain sectors rules on the continuation and modification of operational programmes and work programmes.

Regulation (EU) No 228/2013

The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 concern the relevant amounts of Union support available for specific measures for the transitional period in line with the MFF 2021-2027.

Regulation (EU) No 229/2013

The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 229/2013 concern the relevant amounts of Union support available for specific measures for the transitional period in line with the MFF 2021-2027.

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

laying down certain transitional provisions for the support by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in the year 2021 and amending Regulations (EU) No 228/2013, (EU) No 229/2013 and (EU) No 1308/2013 as regards resources and their distribution in respect of the year 2021 and amending Regulations  (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 as regards their resources and application in the year 2021

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

4

,

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

5

,

Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)

The Commission’s

legislative proposals

6

on the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020 aim

ed

to make the CAP more responsive to current and future challenges such as climate change or generational renewal, while continuing to support farmers

in the Union

for a sustainable and comp

etitive agricultural sector. Tho

se proposals are closely

linked to the multiannual financial framework (MFF) of the Union for the years 2021 to 2027.

(2) The Commission proposed to link the CAP to the delivery of performance (‘delivery model’). Under the new legal framework, the Union is to set the policy parameters, such as objectives of the CAP and basic requirements. A strong Union framework is essential to ensuring that the CAP remains a common policy and to ensure a level playing field. Member States are also to have a greater responsibility as regards how they meet the objectives and achieve targets. Accordingly, Member States are to draw up CAP Strategic Plans, based on an ex-ante analysis and an assessment of needs, which are to be approved by the Commission and implemented by Member States.

(2a) With a view to the next reform of the CAP, and taking into account the new ambitions set out in the Commission’s Communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal (“the European Green Deal”), Member States should further promote agro-environmental and climate-related measures in force and any other tool that can help farmers in their efforts towards an ecological transition.

(2b) In its resolution of 14 November 2018 on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 – Parliament’s position with a view to an agreement1a, the European Parliament took a position in favour of maintaining the financing of the CAP for the EU-27 at the level of the 2014-2020 budget in real terms, while budgeting the initial amount of the agricultural reserve, namely EUR 383 255 million in 2018 prices (EUR 431 946 million in current prices). The figures provided for in this Regulation should therefore be calculated on the basis of the figures agreed for the MFF 2021-2027 or, should that MFF not be adopted in time, on the basis of extended 2020 ceilings and provisions in accordance with Article 312(4) TFEU.

(3) The legislative procedure was not concluded in time to allow Member States and the Commission to prepare all elements necessary to apply the new legal framework and the CAP Strategic Plans as of 1 January 2021, as initially proposed by the Commission. That delay creates uncertainty and risks for farmers and the entire agriculture sector. In order to alleviate that uncertainty, this Regulation should provide for the continued application of the current rules and uninterrupted payments to the farmers and other beneficiaries, and thus provide predictability and stability during the transitional period until the date of application of the new legal framework (“transitional period”).

(3a) The continuity and predictability of the support to farmers through the CAP is essential for the stability of the agricultural sector, as well as for maintaining the vitality of rural areas and regions, and is contributing to environmental sustainability.



(4) Therefore, in order to ensure that support can be granted to farmers and other beneficiaries from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in 2021 and, where applicable, in 2022, the Union should continue to grant such support for one or, where applicable, two more years under the conditions of the existing legal framework, which covers the period 2014 to 2020. Member States should ensure the uninterrupted continuation of that support to farmers and other beneficiaries during the transitional period. The existing legal framework is laid down in particular in Regulations (EU) No 1303/20137, (EU) No 1305/20138, (EU) No 1306/20139, (EU) No 1307/201310, (EU) No 1308/201311, (EU) No 228/201312 and (EU) No 229/201313 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In addition, to facilitate the transition from existing support schemes to the new legal framework which was planned to cover the period starting on 1 January 2022, rules should be laid down to regulate how certain support granted on a multiannual basis will be integrated into the new legal framework.

	
(4a) This Regulation should provide the Member States with sufficient time to prepare their respective CAP national strategic plans, as well as the administrative structures necessary for successful implementation of the new legal framework. This should not discourage Member States from presenting their respective national strategic plans in a timely manner. All CAP strategic plans should be ready to enter into force once the transitional period ends. This would provide much-needed stability and certainty for the farming sector.


 

(4b) In order to achieve a successful modernisation and simplification of the CAP, the Member States and the Commission should extensively consult farmers and all relevant stakeholders during the preparation of Member States’ CAP Strategic Plans and in order to contribute to the European Green Deal and the Farm to Fork Strategy. Preparatory work on the development of Member States’ CAP Strategic Plans should be undertaken without delay to ensure a smooth transition for beneficiaries into a new programming period.

(5) In light of the fact that the Union should continue to support rural development throughout the transitional period, Member States, that demonstrate the risk to run out of funds and not to be able to undertake new legal commitments for all or certain measures and the resulting expenditure in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, should have the possibility to extend their rural development programmes or certain of their regional rural development programmes supported by the EAFRD throughout the transitional period and to finance those extended programmes from the budget allocation for the corresponding years. The extended programmes should aim at maintaining at least the same overall level of environment and climate ambition, thereby requiring at least the same percentage of EAFRD expenditure for the measures referred to in Article 59(6) of that Regulation.

(6) Since certain Member States may still have funds provided by the Union in previous years, Member States should also have the possibility not to extend their rural development programmes or not to extend certain of their regional rural development programmes or to complete the remaining funds with part of the allocations for the years of the transitional period as needed. Those Member States should have the possibility to transfer the EAFRD budget allocation for 2021 or where applicable, for 2022, or the part of the EAFRD budget allocation that was not used for extending their corresponding to the regional rural development programmes that have not been extended, to the financial allocations for the remaining of the programming period, in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) …/…[Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027]14.

(7) In order to allow the Commission to provide the necessary financial planning and the corresponding adjustments of the annual breakdowns of the Union support set out in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, Member States should inform the Commission soon after the entry into force of this Regulation whether they decide to extend their rural development programmes and, in case of regional rural development programmes, which of those programmes they decide to extend, and if they intend to fund them partly with remaining funds for the previous budget allocation, and consequently which corresponding amount of the budget allocation for the years during the transitional period is not to be transferred to the following years.

(8) Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 lays down common rules applicable to the EAFRD and some other Funds, which operate under a common framework. That Regulation should continue to apply to programmes supported by the EAFRD for the 2014–2020 programming period as well as to those programmes supported by the EAFRD for which Member States decide to extend that period to 31 December 2021 or, where applicable, to 31 December 2022. For those Member States, the Partnership Agreement drawn up for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 should continue to be used as a strategic document by Member States and the Commission with regard to the implementation of support granted by the EAFRD for the programming year 2021 or, where applicable, the programming year 2022.

(10) Regulation (EU) No 1310/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council15 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 807/201416 provide that expenditure for certain long-term commitments undertaken pursuant to certain regulations that granted support for rural development before Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 should continue to be paid by the EAFRD in the 2014-2020 programming period under certain conditions. That expenditure should also continue to be eligible for the duration of their respective legal commitment under the same conditions in the programming year 2021 or, where applicable, the programming year 2022. For reasons of legal clarity and certainty, it also should be clarified that the legal commitments undertaken under measures that correspond to measures of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 to which the integrated administration and control system applies, should be subject to this integrated administration and control system and that payments related to these legal commitments have to be made within the period from 1 December to 30 June of the following calendar year.

(12)

In the allocation of payment entitlements (or recalculation for Member States keeping existing entitlements) in 2015 under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, some Member States made errors in the establishment of the number or value of payment entitlements.

Many of those

errors

,

even

when occurred

for a single farmer

,

influence the value of the payment entitlements for all farmers and for all years. Some Member States made errors also after 2015, when allocating entitlements from the reserve (e.g. in the calculation of the average value).

These

non-compliance

s are

normally subject to financial correction until corrective measures are taken

by the Member State concerned. In the light of

the

time

that has elap

sed since the first allocation,

the efforts made by Member States to establish, and where relevant, correct entitlements

,

and

also

i

n the interest of legal certainty, the

number and value

of payment entitlements should be considered

legal and regular

with effect from a certain date.

(13)

However, t

he confirmation of payment entitlements does not represent an exemption from the Member States’ responsibility under the shared management of

the

EAGF to ensure the protection of the

Union

budget from irregular expenditure. Hence, the confirmation of the payment entitlements allocated to farmers before 1 January 202

0, as from 1 January 2021, should

not prejudice the Commission’s power to take decisions referred to in Article 52 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 in relation to irregular payments granted in respect of any calendar year up to 2020 included, resulting from erro

rs in the number or value of tho

se payment entitlements.

(14) In light of the fact that the CAP Strategic Plans to be prepared by Member States in accordance with the new legal framework are to be applicable as of 1 January 2022 or 1 January 2023, as applicable, transitional rules should be laid down to regulate the transition from existing support schemes to the new legal framework, in particular Regulation (EU) …/… of the European Parliament and of the Council 18[CAP Strategic Plan Regulation]. In accordance with the principles set out in the European Code of Conduct on Partnership established by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 240/201418a, Member States should ensure participation of regional and local authorities, civil society organisations, including beneficiaries, at all stages of preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the transitional measures and programmes.

(14a) The transitional rules provided for in this Regulation are intended to allow the measures currently in force to be extended for the duration of the transitional period. During the transitional period and in order to anticipate as far as possible the implementation of the future renewed legal framework for the CAP, the Member States, in their work and their consultations on the prefiguration of their future CAP strategic plans, should focus on the new tools provided for, and in particular on the possibility for new sectors to develop operational programmes.

(15)

Certain

expenditure for certain long-term commitments undertaken pursuant to Regulations that granted support for

rural development before Regulation (EU) 1305/2013

were

still eligible in the programming period 2014-2020.

With the exception of cases where the duration of these long-term commitments has elapsed, t

his expenditure should continue to be eligible

during the

period

covered by the

CAP Strategic Plan

for the duration of the

respective

legal

commitment

s

subject to the contribution rate applicable in th

at

period and provided that it

is inserted in the CAP Strategic Plan

and that the expenditure is paid in line with Regulation (EU) [HzR]

.

The same should apply to certain long-term commitments that have been taken under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 or

Regulation

(EU) No 1303/2013.

In this context it should

be clarified that the

legal

commitments undertaken under measures that correspond to area- and animal based types of interventions determined in the CAP Strategic Plan should be subject to the integrated administration and control system

and that payments related to tho

se

legal

commitments have to be made within the period from 1 December to 30 June of the following calendar year.

(16) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets and includes certain aid schemes in Articles 29 to 60. Those aid schemes should be integrated in the future CAP Strategic Plans of the Member States as sectoral interventions referred to in points (a) to (e) of Article 39 of Regulation (EU) …/… [CAP Strategic Plan Regulation]. To ensure coherence, continuity and a smooth transition between those aid schemes of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the sectoral types of interventions of Regulation (EU) …/… [CAP Strategic Plan Regulation], rules should be laid down regarding the duration of each of those aid schemes.

(17) As regards the aid scheme in the olive oil and table olives sector, the existing work programmes drawn up for the period running from 1 April 2018 until 31 March 2021 should be extended until the end of the transitional period. For aid schemes in the fruit and vegetables sector, rules should be laid down regarding the modification or replacement of operational programmes. The recognised producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector should also have the possibility to maintain the operational programme until it comes to an end.

(18) With the view to ensuring continuity as regards the aid schemes in the fruit and vegetable sector, the wine sector and the apiculture sector, rules need to be laid down that allow those aid schemes to continue to be implemented until the end of their respective programming periods. For this period certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 should therefore continue to apply in relation to expenditure incurred and payments made for operations implemented pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 after 31 December 2021 and until the end of those aid schemes and of the operational programmes.

(19) In order to limit a significant carry-over of commitments from the current programming period for rural development to the CAP Strategic Plans, the duration of new multiannual commitments in relation to agri-environment-climate, organic farming and animal welfare should, as a general rule, be limited to a period of maximum of five years. Once Regulation (EU) .../... [CAP Strategic Plan Regulation] applies, the rules concerning those commitments should be adapted in accordance with that Regulation. The extension of existing commitments should be limited to one year.


(20) The EAFRD should be able to support Community-led local development set up in accordance with the new rules laid down by Regulation (EU) XXXX/XXXX [New CPR]. However, in order to avoid unspent funds for Community-led local development in the programming year 2021 or, where applicable, the programming year 2022, Member States that decide to extend their rural development programmes and that also make use of the possibility to transfer amounts from direct payments to rural development, should be able to apply the 5% minimum allocation for Community-led local development only to the EAFRD contribution to the rural development extended to 31 December 2021 or, where applicable, 31 December 2022, calculated before the transfer of amounts from direct payment has been done.

(21) In order to ensure continuity in the transitional period, the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector should be maintained for 2021 and, where applicable, for 2022, and the relevant amount of the reserve for 2021 and, where applicable, for 2022, should be included.

(22) As regards prefinancing arrangements from the EAFRD, it should be made clear that where Member States decide to extend the 2014–2020 period to 31 December 2021 or, where applicable, 31 December 2022, this should not lead to any additional prefinancing granted for the programmes concerned.

(23) Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 currently only provides for a notification obligation for Member States as regards their decisions and the estimated product related to the reduction of the part of the amount of direct payments to be granted to a farmer for a given calendar year exceeding EUR 150 000 for the years 2015 to 2020. With a view to ensuring a continuation of the existing system, Member States should also notify their decisions and the estimated product of reduction for calendar year 2021 and, where applicable, calendar year 2022.

(24) Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 allows Member States to transfer funds between direct payments and rural development as regards calendar years 2014 to 2020. In order to ensure that Member States may keep their own strategy, the flexibility between pillars should be made available also for calendar year 2021 (i.e. financial year 2022) and, where applicable, calendar year 2022 (i.e. financial year 2023).

(25) In order to allow the Commission to be able to set the budgetary ceilings in accordance with Articles 22(1), 36(4), 42(2), 47(3), 49(2), 51(4) and 53(7) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, it is necessary that Member States notify their decisions on financial allocations by scheme for calendar year 2021 by 1 August 2020 and, where applicable, their decisions on financial allocations by scheme for calendar year 2022 by 1 August 2021.

(25a) Member States should be able to continue to use transitional national aid during the period of application of this Regulation. In order to reduce the competitive differences between farmers in the Member States as a result of differences in payment per hectare, Member States should maintain transitional national aid for the duration of the transitional period.

(26)

Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides for a linear adjustment of the value of entitlements in case of a change in the ceiling for the basic payment scheme from one year to the following due to certain decisions taken by Member States and affecting the ceiling for the basic payment scheme. The extension of Annex II

to that Regulation

on national ceilings after calendar year 2020 and the possible annual changes from that date might have an impact on the ceiling for the basic payment scheme.

Therefore, for Member States to be able to respect the obligation

of

equality of the sum of the value of entitlements and reserve(s) with the ceiling for the basic payment scheme

laid down

in Article 22(4)

of

that Regulation

, it is appropriate to provide for a linear adjustment

to adapt

to

the extension of

or

the changes in

that

Annex II

during the transitional period

. Moreover,

to provide

greater

flexibility

to Member States, it appears appropriate to allow Member States to adapt the value of entitlements or of the reserve, possibly with different rates of adjustment

.

(27) In accordance with the current legal framework, Member States notified in 2014 their decisions up to calendar year 2020, on the division of the annual national ceiling for the basic payment scheme between the regions and the possible annual progressive modifications for the period covered by Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. It is necessary that Member States also notify those decisions for calendar year 2021 and, where applicable, calendar year 2022.

(28) The internal convergence mechanism is the core process for a more equitable distribution of direct income support among farmers. Significant individual differences based on old historic references become more and more difficult to justify. In Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, the basic model of internal convergence consists in the application by Member States of a uniform flat rate for all payment entitlements, at national or regional level, from 2015. However, for the sake of ensuring a smoother transition to a uniform value, a derogation was set out allowing Member States to differentiate the values of payment entitlements by applying partial convergence, also called the ‘tunnel model’, between 2015 and 2019. Some Member States made use of this derogation. To continue the process towards a more equitable distribution of direct payments, Member States should further converge towards a national or regional average after 2019 instead of going to a uniform flat rate. They should notify annually their decision for the following year.

(29) Article 30 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides for the annual progressive modifications in the value of the payment entitlements allocated from the reserve to reflect the annual steps of the national ceiling set in Annex II to that Regulation, reflecting a “multiannual” management of the reserve. Those rules should be adapted so to reflect that it is possible to amend both the value of all allocated entitlements and of the reserve to adjust to a change in the amount in that Annex II between two years. Moreover, in some Member States not having reached a flat rate by 2019, internal convergence is implemented on an annual basis. For calendar years 2020 and 2021 and, where applicable, calendar year 2022, only the value of the payment entitlement of the current year needs to be determined in the year of allocation. The unit value of entitlements to be allocated from the reserve in a given year should be calculated after possible adjustment of the reserve in accordance with Article 22(5) of that Regulation. In any subsequent year, the value of the payment entitlements allocated from the reserve should be adapted in accordance with that Article 22(5).

(30) Article 36 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides the application of the single area payment scheme (SAPS) until 31 December 2020. The CAP Strategic Plan Regulation (EU) …/… [CAP Strategic Plan Regulation] allows Member States to implement a basic income support with the same modalities, i.e. without the allocation of payment entitlements based on historic references. Therefore, it is appropriate to allow the prolongation of SAPS in 2021 and, where applicable, in 2022.

(31)

For the sake of legal certainty, i

t

should be clarified

that Articles 41 and 42 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 allow Member States to review, on an annual basis, their decisions on the redistributive payment.

(32)

Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013, (EU) No 1307/2013, (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly

.

(33)

As

regards the clarification on

convergence from the year 2020, point

6

of Article 1

0

should apply retroactively from 1 January 2020.

(34) The financial allocations provided for in Regulations (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 should apply from 1 January 2021 in line with Regulation (EU) …/…[Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027].

34a) Given their very small size and their insularity, local markets in the outermost regions, as referred to in Article 349 TFEU, are particularly vulnerable to price fluctuations linked to import flows from the rest of the Union or from third countries. Therefore, the interbranch organisations, recognised under Article 157 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, particularly in the livestock sectors, take collective measures, in particular for compiling data and disseminating information, designed to ensure that local production remains competitive on the local market in question. To that end, notwithstanding Articles 28, 29 and 110 TFEU, and without prejudice to Articles 164 and 165 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, it is appropriate to allow the Member State concerned, in the context of extended interbranch agreements and after consultation with the stakeholders concerned, to make individual operators or groups of economic operators who are not members of the interbranch organisation but which operate on the local market in question, irrespective of their origin, pay that organisation all or part of the financial contributions paid by its members, including in cases where the proceeds of these contributions fund measures to maintain only local production or where the contributions are levied at a different stage in the marketing process.

(34b) Due to their geographical situation, in particular their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, the outermost regions, as referred to in Article 349 TFEU, are faced with specific socio-economic problems related to the supply of food and agricultural products essential for consumption or agricultural production. Specific measures in the agricultural sector, to remedy the difficulties caused by the specific situation, as provided for in that Article, were established in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013. In order to respect the continuity principle, this Regulation advocates respecting the maintenance of the budget during the transitional period. For the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI) scheme and for the specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands, it is appropriate to reinstate the financial allocations at their current levels provided for in Regulations (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013.


34c) In the event that a proposal for a Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 (MFF Regulation) and the related proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (CAP Strategic Plan Regulation) have not been adopted and published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 30 October 2020, the transitional period originally proposed in this Regulation ending on 31 December 2021 should, as a last resort, be extended by a further year to 31 December 2022. In that event, the corresponding transitional rules and conditions applicable to the original transitional period should continue to apply during the extended transitional period and the budget allocations and applicable timeframes should be adapted accordingly. This should provide sufficient incentive and allow the European Parliament and the Council to successfully adopt the new legislative framework for the CAP, while at the same time ensure the necessary stability for the beneficiaries.


Article -1

 

Transitional period

 

1. For the purpose of this Regulation, ‘transitional period’ means the period starting on 1 January 2021 and ending on 31 December 2021.

 

2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article and only in the event that the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 and the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the Common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council have not been adopted and published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 30 October 2020, the transitional period for the purpose of this Regulation shall be extended to 31 December 2022.

Continued application of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 during the transitional period and extension of certain periods under Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 and (EU) No 1310/2013

Article

1

Extension of the period for programmes supported by the EAFRD

1.

For programmes supported by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), Member States that risk, due to the lack of financial resources, not to be able to undertake new legal commitments in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, may extend the period laid down in Article 26(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to the transitional period referred to in Article -1 of this Regulation.

Member States that decide to make use of the possibility provided in the first subparagraph shall notify the Commission of their decision within 10 days after the entry into force of this Regulation. Where Member States have submitted a set of regional programmes in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, that notification shall also contain information on which of the regional programmes are to be extended and on the corresponding budgetary allocation within the annual breakdown for the year 2021 as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.

Where the Commission considers that an extension of the period under the first subparagraph is not justified, it shall inform the Member State thereof within four weeks after receipt of the notification referred to in the second subparagraph. The Commission shall base the evaluation of the request for extension on clear and objective criteria in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, which shall be communicated to the Member State concerned. The Commission shall provide the Member State concerned with the reasons justifying its refusal of the extension, as well as with, if possible, specific recommendations as to how to improve the notification in order to make it applicable. The Member State concerned may, within four weeks of being provided with such recommendations by the Commission, submit an updated notification explaining how it will implement the Commission´s recommendations on the applicability of the extension.

The notification referred to in the second subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the need to submit a request to amend a rural development programme for the year 2021 and, where Article-1(2) of this Regulation applies, for the year 2022, as referred to in point (a) of Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013. Such amendment shall not be taken into account for the limit of annual modifications as provided for in the rules adopted on the basis of Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013. That amendment shall guarantee the same percentage of the EAFRD expenditure for the measures referred to in Article 59(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.

Member States that decide to make use of the possibility provided for in the first subparagraph may compensate for any reductions in the overall allocations in the EAFRD for the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) period with a corresponding increase in their national co-financing.

2.

For Member States that do not decide to make use of the possibility provided in paragraph 1 of this Article, Article [8] of Regulation (EU)…/…[Regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027] shall apply to the allocation not used for the year 2021 and, where Article -1(2) of this Regulation applies, for the year 2022, as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.

Where a Member State decides to make use of the possibility provided in paragraph 1 only with regard to certain regional programmes, the allocation referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be the amount set out for that Member State for 2021 and, where Article -1(2) of this Regulation applies, for 2022, in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 minus the budgetary allocations notified in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 for the regional programmes that are extended.

Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative

The present proposal aims at ensuring continuity of certain elements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for a one-year transitional period from the 2014-2020 period until the application of the rules for  the CAP strategic plans further to the Commission proposal (COM(2018) 392 final). Further explanations are part of the explanatory memorandum to the present proposals and in point 1.4.1 of the legislative financial statement that accompanied the Commission proposal for the period post 2020 COM(2018) 392 final).

MANAGEMENT MEASURES

1.1.

Monitoring and reporting rules

Specify frequency and conditions.

No substantive change compared to the existing legislation

1.2.

Management and control system(s)

1.2.1.

Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed

With a view to ensuring smooth continuity in the necessary transition to the CAP strategic plans, this proposal maintains existing management modes through shared management as well as payment and control modalities for the necessary period. As such it builds on the well-functionning systems already set up by the Member States.

1.2.2.

Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them

The steady low error rate levels under the CAP in the most recent years show that the management and control systems set up by the Member States function properly and provide reasonable assurance. The transitional provisions provide for status quo as regards control systems.

1.2.3.

Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of "control costs ÷ value of the related funds managed"), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)

The proposals maintains status quo as regards controls.

1.3.

Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities

Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy.

No changes proposed to the existing measures.

The amounts included in the transitional proposal are in line with amounts proposed for the CAP under Heading 3 in the proposal covering the Multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 for the relevant financial years in COM (2018) 322 final/2.

Therefore, for market-related expenditure financed by the EAGF, allocations under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will be adjusted to the level which were proposed for the same sectors in the proposal on support for the CAP strategic plans (COM (2018) 392 final), for financial year 2021. Also the allocations for the outermost regions and the Aegean islands in Regulations (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 are adjusted to the level already proposed for the year 2021 (cf. COM(2018) 394 final).

The proposed direct payments allocations for calendar year 2021, which are financed in financial year 2022, equals the allocations proposed for direct payments types of interventions for calendar year 2021 in COM (2018) 392 final.

For the sake of ensuring continuity of rural development, the proposal adds allocations for 2021. These equal the amounts which were proposed for rural development types of interventions for the same year in COM (2018) 392 final. In case where the Member States decide not to extend their 2014-2020 rural development programmes, the unused allocations for 2021 are to be reprogrammed to the 2022-2025 allocations for the CAP Strategic plan.

The reserve for agricultural crises referred to in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 as existing in the 2014-2020 period is proposed to be maintained for the transitional period.

Overall, this proposal means that, as regards commitment appropriations, the proposal has no financial impact for the period 2021-2027 compared to what was proposed and described in the financial statement that accompanied the Commission proposal for the CAP for the period post 2020 (COM (2018) 392 final). As regards payment appropriations, the estimated potential impact is explained below but will depend on Member States’ decision as regards the extension of the 2014-2020 rural development programmes.

The financial implications given below reflect the estimated changes compared to the implications set out in the legislative financial statement that accompanied the Commission proposal for the CAP for the period post 2020 (COM (2018) 392 final).

For

EAGF,

the proposal has no impact on overall expenditure compared to the estimates described in the financial statement that accompanied the Commission proposal for the CAP for the period post 2020 (COM (2018) 392 final). The transitional proposal, ensuring continuity of a number of sectoral aid programmes under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (i.e. fruit and vegetables, olive oil, apiculture, wine and hops) until the integration of these programmes under the CAP Plan, implies that the commitments estimated for the sectoral types of interventions under the CAP Plan will remain as market related expenditure outside the CAP Plan for the transitional period. The same applies for direct payments where commitments foreseen under the CAP Plan will remain as direct payments outside the CAP Plan for the transitional period. These changes, as well as the financing of the crisis reserve proposed to be maintained in the transitional period, are neutral as regards overall commitments within each year and for the period and therefore coherent with the Commission proposal as regards the EAGF subceiling for the 2021 – 2027 period.

As regards the

EAFRD

, the proposal remains neutral in terms of commitment appropriations for the period. The decision of Member States as regards the extension of the 2014-2020 rural development programmes will affect the timing of commitments given that the 2021 EAFRD allocations are to transferred to the 2022-2025 EAFRD allocations where no extention is requested by the Member States.

The net impact on the timing of payment appropriations cannot be quantified at present as it will depend on Member States’ decisions which can either delay or accelerate the implementation of payments compared to the timing estimated in the legislative financial statement that accompanied the Commission proposal for the CAP for the period post 2020 (COM (2018) 392 final): extensions of the 2014-2020 rural development programmes are expected to accelerate the payment profile for the given Member States/programmes whereas transfers of the unused 2021 allocations to the 2022-2025 allocations will delay the payments. Overall, payment appropriations remain unchanged for the period.
