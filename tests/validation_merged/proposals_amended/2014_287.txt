Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the tariff treatment for goods originating from Ecuador /* COM/2014/0585 final - 2014/0287 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

On 17 July 2014 the negotiations wereconcluded with Ecuador for its accession to the Trade Agreement concludedbetween the EU and Colombia/Peru. As a result of these negotiations, a Protocolof Accession by Ecuador to the Agreement (hereinafter “the Protocol ofAccession") was initialled on […].

In order to avoid unnecessary tradedisruption pending the completion of the procedures for the approval andapplication of the Protocol of Accession, it is necessary to ensure that customsduties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are notincreased and that no new customs duties are applied on products originating inEcuador. To this end, the proposed Regulation provides for the maintenance ofthe level of duty rates that were applicable to Ecuador on the date ofinitialling of the Protocol of Accession.

This Regulation will apply as of 1 January2015 and until six months after the Protocol of Accession enters into force (or,where appropriate, is applied provisionally), or until 31 December 2016,whichever occurs first. This duration is necessary to provide for sufficienttime to carry out all the necessary internal procedures in the EU, but also in Ecuador, for the application of the Protocol of Accession. Additional delays could beincurred due to the necessary consultation and approval of the Protocol ofAccession by Colombia and Peru prior to the Commission decision on the proposalfor the Council Decisions on signature and provisional application and onconclusion of the Protocol of Accession. The potential six month overlap ofthis Regulation and of the application of the Protocol of Accession is deemednecessary to enable the economic operators to adjust to the new customs procedures.

2.           RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONSWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

Not applicable.

3.           LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THEPROPOSAL

The legal basis for the proposal isArticle 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

4.           BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

The proposed Regulation maintains thecurrent market access arrangements and in this sense does not have anyadditional financial implications for the EU budget. The absence of itsapplication would, however, entail a potential increase in the customs revenuecollection.

The amount of this customs revenuecollection is difficult to predict, but would in any case be relatively small.The duty savings incurred by current market access regime enjoyed by Ecuadorand which lapses on 1 January 2015 are in the range of €215 million (based on2013 trade figures). Ecuador's exports to the EU are highly concentrated and95% of these savings come from exporting essentially 5 product groups with anaverage customs duty of 16%. Therefore, applying the erga omnes dutiesfor these products would significantly reduce their exports to the EU, thusfurther reducing the actual impact on the EU budget.

2014/0287 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

on the tariff treatment for goodsoriginating from Ecuador

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)       The Trade Agreementbetween the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Colombiaand Peru, of the other part (hereinafter “the Agreement”) signed on 26 June2012, provides in its Article 329 for the possible accession to the Agreement ofother Member Countries of the Andean Community.

(2)       Following the request by Ecuador to restart the negotiations with the Union to become a Party to the Agreement, negotiationswere conducted between the Union and Ecuador in 2014. As a result of those negotiations,a Protocol of Accession by Ecuador to the Agreement (hereinafter “the Protocolof Accession”) was initialled on […].

(3)       Following the initiallingof the Protocol of Accession, an interim reciprocal arrangement is necessaryfor the establishment of a free-trade area with Ecuador in order to avoidunnecessary trade disruption. Therefore, as from 1 January 2015, customs dutiesapplied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increasednor new customs duties applied on products originating in Ecuador.

(4)       This Regulation thereforeprovides for the maintenance of the level of duty rates applicable to Ecuador on [date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession] as from 1 January 2015.

(5)       This measure is withoutprejudice to measures taken under Council Regulations (EC) Nos 597/2009[1], 1225/2009[2] or 260/2009[3].

(6)       As a condition for theapplication of the tariff treatment granted under this Regulation, Ecuadorshould abstain from introducing new duties or charges having equivalent effector new quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect forimports originating in the Union, or from increasing existing levels of dutiesor charges or from introducing any other restrictions from [the date ofinitialling of the Protocol of Accession].

(7)       To ensure that Ecuador maintains its commitment to core international conventions on human and labourrights, environmental protection and good governance, the application of thismeasure should be subject to the continued and effective implementation ofthose conventions.

(8)       In order to prevent anyrisk of fraud, the entitlement to benefit from the tariff treatment providedunder this Regulation should be conditional on compliance by Ecuador with the relevant rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto.

(9)       It is necessary to providefor the application of Common Customs Tariff duties for any products originatingin Ecuador which cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties to Unionproducers of like or directly competing products, subject to an investigationby the Commission.

(10)     In the event of failure tocomply with any of the conditions laid down in this Regulation, implementingpowers should be conferred on the Commission to suspend temporarily in whole orin part the tariff treatment provided therein. Those powers should be exercisedin accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament andthe Council[4].

(11)     This Regulation is to beapplied until six months after the entry into force or date of provisionalapplication of the relevant provisions of the Protocol of Accession, and until31 December 2016 at the latest,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
