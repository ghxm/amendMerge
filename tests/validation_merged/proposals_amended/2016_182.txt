Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

(Text with EEA relevance)

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

•

Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

In 2007, the confidence of financial services' end-users', and in particular that of consumers in the field of financial services, was shaken by the financial and economic crisis. Therefore, the European legislators considered that the concerns of consumers and other financial services end-users should be systematically and adequately taken into account to restore citizens' confidence in the soundness of the financial sector.

Financial services consumers cover a wide range of natural persons using or requesting financial services, including retail investors, savers, insurance holders, pension fund participants and borrowers. While consumers represent the main focus of the present proposal, its objectives might be also relevant for other end-users of financial services, who are using or requesting financial services for purposes which are not outside their trade, business or profession. Several actions have been undertaken by the European Commission to ensure that the views of consumers and other end-users of financial services are heard, notably with (i) the establishment in 2010 of the Financial Services Users Group (FSUG) which acts as a forum where non-industry stakeholders’ representatives are regularly kept informed about the financial services policy issues under development and are invited to give their views and express their concerns and suggestions on intended legislative initiatives and (ii) the systematic inclusion of consumers and civil society organisations’ representatives in the various expert groups set up to assist the Commission or the ESAs in their work in the financial services area.

The Commission had also identified the scarcity of resources and specialised expertise among organisations representing these stakeholders as an obstacle to their active participation in the discussions on the Union policy making in the financial services area. Consumer bodies as well as civil society organisations did not have adequate resources to properly cover a wide range of often highly technical topics and contribute relevant input in the Union financial services policy making. This was unsatisfactory because the Commission could not benefit from the widest possible range of views and inputs and was perceived by some civil society organisations as being unduly influenced by industry contributions.

In that context, the Commission launched at the end of 2011 a pilot project aiming to provide grants to support the development of a financial expertise centre to the benefit of end-users and non-industry stakeholders and enhance their capacity to participate in Union policy making in the field of financial services. Following successive open calls for proposals, the Commission awarded operating grants to two non-profit organisations based in Brussels, Finance Watch and Better Finance between 2012 and 2015.

The two non-profit organisations mainly conducted research work, policy analysis, advocacy and communication activities during that period. In 2015, an evaluation of the pilot project and the subsequent preparatory action was conducted in order to decide on potential further steps in this area.

The evaluation concluded that the policy objectives of the pilot project and the preparatory action had generally been met. However, the evaluation underlined that both organisations were not financially sustainable without Union funding, despite efforts to diversify their resources during these three years. Stopping funding as of 2017 would lead the organisations to reduce dramatically or even cease their activities, which would have meant that the policy objectives could no longer be achieved. In the same vein, reducing the level of co-funding would be risky since both organisations would have to cut staff immediately, already limiting their activities in 2017, and likely stop them quite rapidly.

Co-funding these beneficiaries along the same line as of 2017 is the only option which can  ensure that all the results and effects that have materialised since 2012 according to the evaluation results are likely to continue. This will enable to further increase the involvement of consumers, other end-users of financial services and stakeholders representing their interests in Union policy-making in the financial sector.

•

Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area

This Union programme will complement existing policy initiatives, such as the activities carried out by the Financial Services User Group (FSUG) since 2010, or by other expert groups set up to assist the Commission or the European Supervisory Authorities (e.g ESAs stakeholders groups) in the Union policy making for financial services.

This Union programme will complement existing Union consumer policy. By contributing to a better informed and balanced Union policy making in the financial sector and by providing better communication to the public around European financial regulation, this Programme will help restore citizens' confidence in the European financial system.

2.

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

•

Legal basis

The legal basis is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 169(2)(b) thereof. The proposed Union programme will contribute to ensuring a high level of protection and to placing consumers at the heart of the single market in the field of financial services, by supporting and complementing Member States' policies in seeking to ensure that citizens can fully reap the benefits of the internal market and that, in so doing, their legal and economic interests are properly addressed and defended. In accordance with the Commission legislative policy adopted in the framework of the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the present funding programme is proposed as a Regulation.

•

Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)

The Union programme provides for the possibility to co-finance activities carried out by two beneficiaries aiming to enhance the involvement of consumers and other end-users, as well as stakeholders representing their interests in the field of financial services. The proposal complies with the subsidiarity principle since, in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union, its objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, by reason of the scale and the effect of the action, be better achieved at Union level.

In particular, the evaluation assessed positively the Union added value of the previous pilot project and preparatory action: national organisations dealing with all kinds of consumers issues lack technical expertise and cannot cover such a broad scope of policy areas related to financial services. In addition, no other similar organisations have been identified at EU level.

•

Proportionality

The proposal complies with the proportionality principle as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. As assessed in the ex-ante evaluation accompanying the Commission proposal for the Financing Regulation, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to maintain the impacts and effects achieved so far through the previous pilot project and preparatory action. Union funding is proposed for two well-identified beneficiaries whose activities, outputs and impacts have been evaluated in 2015. Within the current institutional framework, the new funding arrangements will ensure stable, sound and adequate funding to achieve the policy objectives. Financial support will be granted according to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.

•

Choice of the instrument

The most appropriate legal instrument to be used in the present case, on the basis of Article 169(2)(b), in order to establish a Union programme to support specific activities enhancing the involvement of consumers and other end-users as well as stakeholders representing their interests in Union policy making in the field of financial services, is a regulation.

3.

RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

•

Ex-post evaluations of existing legislation

According to the ex-post evaluation

, the Commission considers that the objectives set for the pilot project and the subsequent preparatory action has been generally achieved. The overall objective to develop a European financial center of expertise has been met with two complementary centers of expertise having emerged. The activities implemented by both beneficiaries contributed to providing European policy-makers with other views than those expressed by the financial industry in that period and by succeeding in communicating those views to the wider public. Both Finance Watch and Better Finance have been in close contact with Union policy makers since 2012, as evidenced by their participation in various meetings and hearings in national or European Parliaments. Their expertise, shared in a number of publications and responses to consultations, enabled them to bring another voice in the public debate. Lastly, both developed effective communication capacity which enabled them to inform their members and even a wider public about the issues at stake in the financial sector. Finance Watch and Better Finance have been working on different policy areas and targeted different audiences, but together they have covered, through their activities, most of the Union financial political agenda since 2012.

Finance Watch was set up thanks to these Union grants,

and received €3.04 million financial contributions between 2012 and 2014. The assessment found that its organisation, staff and activities are very relevant towards achieving the objectives of the pilot project and preparatory action. Finance Watch clearly focused on the financial reform agenda following the crisis and covered a significant part of the Union political agenda between 2012 and 2014. The expertise provided during that period (research reports, position papers, responses to consultations, press releases) has been generally well-perceived. On the communication side, Finance Watch set up a dedicated website, managed to have a relatively strong media presence and to organize two high-level conferences per year since 2012. The organisation was found less effective in enhancing the capacity of end-users, consumers in Union policy making in the financial sector, and this could be linked to its heterogeneous membership (low leverage outside Brussels). Its yearly budget amounted to €1.8 million in average, with almost two-thirds of its resources allocated to hire highly qualified staff (14 staff members) to conduct its activities. The organisation's cost-per-output ratio (publications, events & meetings, communication) was assessed as stable between 2012 and 2014.

Better Finance

received €0.90 million operating grants in three years. The organisation managed to form a financial centre of expertise focusing mostly on the interests of private investors, individual shareholders, savers and other end-users of financial services in coherence with its membership base and limited resources. Better Finance's organisation, members and activities have been assessed as very relevant towards the objectives of the pilot project on specific policy areas. However, its secretariat was assessed as somewhat fragile with limited size (5 staff members), limited number of financial experts and difficulties faced during that period to keep stable resources. As regards its actual impact in Union policy-making, the organisation was considered to be effective with Brussels-based Union policy makers on a number of specific dossiers, and maybe even more in the realm of second and third-level legislations with the ESAs. Thanks to the Union operating grants, Better Finance could effectively increase its communication potential, developing a professional website and hiring dedicated staff. Its research work largely focused on pensions during that period.

Since 2012, both beneficiaries have been funded up to 60% of their eligible costs through Union grants and they remain heavily dependent on Union funding. Despite regular efforts, Finance Watch managed to attract only one other stable and significant donor, Adessium Foundation, whose contribution is not confirmed after 2016. Finance Watch's members are not likely to compensate this loss. The situation appears even worse for Better Finance. Besides the grant, the organisation has benefited during the period under evaluation (2012-2014) from a significant and recurrent contribution from one of its members. The important reduction of this contribution in 2015 may prove a threat for Better Finance's sustainability.

Finally, looking at the Union added value brought by this pilot project and preparatory action, the evaluation concluded that both organisations definitely added value to Union policy making in the area of financial services. At the Union level, there are few organisations that represent the general interest of consumers, and no civil society organisations that specifically focus on the financial sector and its regulation. Between 2012 and 2014, in the context of the yearly calls for proposals, no alternative initiative to Finance Watch and Better Finance made itself known. The assessment established that both organisations through their actions added value with respect to the activities of their national members and benefited to European end-users in a way that national consumer advocacy groups have not been able to deliver.

•

Stakeholder consultations

The ex-post evaluation included a targeted consultation encompassing a broad on-line survey and targeted interviews of all relevant stakeholders:

–

All members of the beneficiaries (both organisations and individuals)

–

A number of policy makers including Members of the European Parliament (MEPs mainly from ECON committee), COM officials (FISMA and JUST), representatives from the three ESAs and representatives from national authorities

–

Donors, other funders of the beneficiaries

–

Consumer organisations

–

Representatives from the Banking industry

–

Financial experts

–

Think tanks involved in the financial sector

•

Impact assessment

Considering the conclusions of the recent ex-post evaluation on the previous pilot project and subsequent preparatory action - including the outputs of the targeted consultation conducted in that context- and also the limited scale of the new Union programme, it was decided to accompany the proposal for a legal base by an ex-ante evaluation according to the financial regulation. No impact assessment was therefore carried out in that context.

4.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

The proposed regulation will result in a programme running for the period 2017-2020 with an overall maximum budget of EUR 6 000 000 to support the activities carried out by Finance Watch and Better Finance. This programme follows a pilot project (2012-2013) and a preparatory action (2014-2016). The budgetary implications of this proposal are presented in the financial statement in the annex.

2016/0182 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

on establishing a Union programme to support specific activities enhancing the involvement of consumers and other financial services end-users in Union policy making in the field of financial services for the period of 2017-2020

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point (b) of Article 169(2) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1)

The Union contributes to ensuring a high level of consumer protection and to placing consumers at the heart of the single market by supporting and complementing Member States' policies in seeking to ensure that citizens can fully reap the benefits of the internal market and that, in so doing, their legal and economic interests are properly addressed and defended. A well-functioning and trustworthy financial services sector is a key component of the single market. It requires a solid framework for regulation and supervision, which simultaneously ensures financial stability and focuses on supporting a sustainable economy. At the same time, it should provide a high level of protection to consumers and other financial services end-users, including

retail investors, savers, insurance holders, pension fund participants, individual shareholders, borrowers or SMEs

.

(2)

Since 2007, the confidence of consumers in particular and of other financial services' end-users has been shaken by the financial and economic crisis. To restore citizens' confidence in the soundness of the financial sector, it is therefore important to increase the involvement of consumers and other end-users, as well as of stakeholders representing their interests, in the Union decision-making process in the financial sector.

(3)

To achieve this objective, the Commission initiated at the end of 2011 a pilot project aimed at providing grants to support the development of a financial expertise centre to the benefit of consumers, other end-users and stakeholders representing their interests and to enhance their capacity to participate in Union policy making in the field of financial services. The main policy objectives were to ensure that Union policy-makers, when initiating new legislation, would be provided with views other than those expressed by the financial sector professionals, that the wider public is better informed about issues at stake in financial regulation and that the participation of consumers, is enhanced in Union policy-making in the area of financial services, resulting in well-balanced legislation.

(4)

As a result, the Commission awarded between 2012 and 2015 via an open call for proposals operating grants to two non-profit entities, Finance Watch and Better Finance. These grants were awarded under a pilot project during two years, 2012 and 2013, and a preparatory action since 2014. Since a preparatory action can be used up to three years

, a legislative act is necessary to provide a legal basis for funding such actions as of 2017.

(5)

Finance Watch was set up in 2011 as an international non-profit association under Belgian law. Its mission is to defend the interests of civil society in the financial sector.

Thanks to Union grants, Finance Watch in a short period of time managed to set up a qualified team of experts, able to conduct studies, policy analysis and communication activities in the field of financial services.

(6)

Better Finance results from successive re-organisations and rebranding of pre-existing European federations of investors and shareholders since 2009. Thanks to Union grants, t

he organisation managed to form a financial centre of expertise, focusing mostly on the interests of consumers, individual investors, individual shareholders, savers and other end-users of financial services, in coherence with its membership base.

(7)

The evaluation of the pilot project and the subsequent preparatory action carried out in 2015 concluded that the policy objectives have been generally achieved. Finance Watch and Better Finance have been working on complementary policy areas and targeted different audiences. Together they have covered, through their activities, most of the Union financial political agenda since 2012.

(8)

Both organisations provided added value both to the sum of activities of their national members and to Union consumers in a way that national consumer advocacy groups were unable to deliver. National organisations dealing with all kinds of consumers' issues lack technical expertise in policy areas related to financial services. In addition, no other similar organisations have been identified at Union level so far. The evaluation also showed that no other applicant responded to the successive yearly calls for proposal since 2012, which tends to show that no other organisation is currently able to carry out similar Union-wide activities.

(9)

However, despite regular efforts, both organisations did not manage to attract stable and significant funding from other donors, independent from the financial industry, and, therefore, remain heavily dependent on Union funding.

Co-funding from the Union is therefore necessary to ensure the resources needed to achieve the desired policy objectives in the coming years, providing financial stability to those organisations who have so far managed to start-up their relevant activities in a short period of time. It is therefore necessary to establish a Union programme for the period 2017-2020 to support the activities of Finance Watch and Better Finance ('Programme').

(10)

Continuing funding of Finance Watch and Better Finance for the period 2017-2020 along the same lines as for the preparatory action would ensure that the positive impacts of the activities of those organisations assessed so far are maintained. The financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme should be based on the average actual costs incurred by each beneficiary between 2012 and 2015. The co-funding rate should remain unchanged.

(11)

Between 2012 and 2015, the two organisations have been co-funded through operating grants. In 2016, it was decided to provide action grants instead, as action grants ensure better control of Union budget spending.

(12)

This Regulation should lay down a financial envelope for the entire duration of the Programme which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management

for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure.

(13)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the establishment of the annual work programmes.

(14)

Every year before 31 December, each beneficiary should submit a description of activities planned for the following year to achieve the policy objectives of the Programme. Those activities should be described in detail, including their objectives, expected results and impact, estimated costs and timeframe as well as relevant indicators to assess them.

(15)

Financial support should be granted in accordance with the conditions laid down in

Regulation (EU, Euratom

)

No 966/2012

and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012

.

(16)

The financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties

.

(17)

Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States,

but can rather

, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Where the implementation of an action is outsourced or subdelegated, in whole or in part, or where it requires the award of a procurement contract or financial support to be given to a third party, the grant agreement or decision shall include the beneficiary's obligation to impose on any third party involved explicit acceptance of those powers of the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF.

Article 9

Evaluation

1.

No later than twelve months before the end of the Programme, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council an evaluation report on the achievement of the Programme's objectives.

1.5.

Grounds for the proposal/initiative

1.5.1.

Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term

A pilot project and a preparatory action can be used only during a limited period of time. To ensure that the results obtained and impacts assessed so far are maintained, the only way forward is a legislative framework providing for funding the same activities.

1.5.2.

Added value of EU involvement

The ex-post evaluation assessed positively the Union added value of the previous pilot project and preparatory action: national organisations dealing with all kinds of consumers issues lack technical expertise and cannot cover such a broad scope of policy areas related to financial services. In addition, no other similar organisations have been identified at Union level. The proposal complies with the subsidiarity principle since, in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union, its objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, by reason of the scale and the effect of the action, be better achieved at Union level.

1.5.3.

Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past

The ex-post evaluation of the previous pilot project and preparatory action assessed that the policy objectives set at the end of 2011 have been overall achieved.

To ensure that the positive impacts assessed so far are maintained, it is therefore necessary to continue funding the same activities along the same lines.

1.5.4.

Coherence and possible synergy with other relevant instruments

This Union programme will complement existing policy initiatives, such as the activities carried out by the Financial Services User Group (FSUG) since 2010, or by other expert groups set up to assist the Commission or the ESAs (e.g. ESAs stakeholders groups) in the Union policy making for financial services.

This Union programme will complement existing Union consumer policy. By contributing to a stronger involvement of consumers and other end-users in Union policy making in the financial sector and by providing better communication to the public around these issues, this Programme will enable to better represent and voice the interests of consumers and other end-users in this area, thereby restoring citizens' confidence in the European financial system.

MANAGEMENT MEASURES

2.1.

Monitoring and reporting rules

Specify frequency and conditions.

For both beneficiaries : progress reports and final reports

2.2.

Management and control system

2.2.1.

Risk(s) identified

There is a risk of not achieving the operational objectives if the quality of the beneficiaries' output is not in accordance with the initial objectives as described in the annual proposals

There is a risk of threat to the EU financial interests/reputation if Commission's services fail to identify ineligible expenditure

2.2.2.

Information concerning the internal control system set up

Risk of not achieving operational objectives:

– Beneficiaries are requested to submit an annual report, in accordance with the individual objectives of annual proposals and in line with the guidelines of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of 25 October 2012, on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the European Union

– The operational units responsible within DG FISMA have regular contacts with the beneficiaries

Risk of threat to the EU financial interests:

– Controls of grant commitments and payments in DG FISMA follow the reinforced financial circuit and comprise desk checks of relevant supporting documents, including interim and final reports, audited accounts and specific documents requested by the DG. These controls are documented in checklists that are systematically filled in by all actors involved in the respective financial transactions (OIA,OVA,OVA2,FIA, FVA, FVA2, AO), including controls carried out by the DG's financial unit on financial and legal matters in order to deliver the "Bon à Payer"

– The DG's financial unit systematically carries out on-the-spot controls on each beneficiary with substantive testing of a sample of transactions with an aim to assess the beneficiary's financial and internal control system and to provide the AO with additional assurance on the sufficient protection of the EU financial interests

2.2.3.

Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error

The maximum error rate would remain below 2%

The cost of the controls would be below 0.5 FTE or 67.000€ per year.

The benefit of the controls would be 100% of the annual granted amount spent adequately and following the sound financial management principle

2.3.

Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities

Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.

Reinforced financial circuits with both an ex-ante operational and financial verification

Regular analysis of the beneficiaries' accounts, annual reports and audit certificates

On-the-spot regular audits to verify financial systems and controls
