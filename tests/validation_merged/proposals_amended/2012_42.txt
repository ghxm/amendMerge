Proposal for a DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on accounting rules and action plans on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities related to land use, land use change and forestry /* COM/2012/093 final - 2012/0042 (COD) */

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

1.           CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

The need to act on climate change now

At the end of 2010, in the context of theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), it was recognisedthat global warming must not exceed the temperatures experienced before theindustrial revolution by more than 2˚ C[1].This is vital if the negative consequences of human interference with theclimate system are to be limited. Global emissions must therefore startdeclining. This long-term goal requires global greenhouse gas emissions to bereduced by at least 50 % below 1990 levels by 2050[2].

Developed countries as a group shouldreduce emissions by 80 to 95 % by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. In themedium term, the Union has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by20 % below 1990 levels by 2020, and by 30 % below if conditions areright[3].The land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector does not form partof that commitment.

However, Directive 2009/29/EC of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 amending Directive2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowancetrading scheme of the Community[4](the EU Emission Trading System, ‘EU ETS’) and Decision No 406/2009/EC of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the effort of MemberStates to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community’sgreenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020[5] (the Effort Sharing Decision, ‘ESD’)note that all sectors of the economy should contribute to reaching the Union’sgreenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2020. Moreover, Article 9 ofDecision No 406/2009/EC invited the Commission to assess the modalities forincluding emissions and removals from activities related to LULUCF in the Unionreduction commitment and to make a legislative proposal, as appropriate, whilstensuring the permanence and environmental integrity of the contribution of thesector, and providing for accurate monitoring and accounting.

Following wide consultation of MemberStates and stakeholders, and an impact assessment, the Commission accordinglyproposes a Decision to provide, as a first step, a legal framework for robust,harmonised and comprehensive accounting rules for LULUCF that are designed toaccommodate its specific profile. The proposal establishes a legalframework for the LULUCF sector which is separate from the frameworksregulating the existing commitments (the EU ETS and ESD), meaning that thesector would not formally be included in the 20 % greenhouse gas emissionreduction target at this stage. Only once robust accounting rules andmonitoring and reporting are in place, the LULUCF sector could be formallyincluded in the Union’s emission reduction targets. To this end, the Commissionhas also put forward a proposal to repeal Decision No 280/2004/EC of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 concerning amechanism for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions and forimplementing the Kyoto Protocol[6],replacing it by a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on amechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and forreporting other information at national and Union level relevant to climatechange[7].

The role of land use and forestry inclimate change

In the Union, emissions of greenhouse gasescome mainly from energy production and other man-made sources. At the sametime, carbon is absorbed (removed) from the atmosphere through photosynthesisand stored in trees and associated wood products, and in other plants andsoils. Therefore, appropriate land uses and management practices in forestryand agriculture can limit emissions of carbon and enhance removals from theatmosphere. Such practices are covered by the LULUCF sector, which comprisesmostly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and removals by terrestrialecosystems, generally estimated as carbon stock changes[8]. In 2009, LULUCF removed anamount of carbon from the atmosphere equivalent to about 9 % of the Union’stotal greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors.

Agriculture, forestry, related industriesand energy are the most important economic sectors relevant for LULUCF and theycan contribute to the reduction of emissions and enhancement of sinks inseveral ways. Agricultural measures, aimed at reducing the conversion ofgrassland and carbon losses from the cultivation of organic soils, couldinclude improving agronomic practices such as using different crop species(e.g. more leguminous crops) and extending crop rotations. Agro-forestrypractices which provide higher soil carbon stocks could contribute by keepinglivestock or growing of food crops on land on which trees are also grown fortimber, energy or other wood products. Organic materials can also be returnedto or left on the land to improve the productivity of croplands and grasslands,while rewetting, setting aside or not draining organic soils, including peatland, and restoring degraded soils can have significant mitigation andbiodiversity benefits. In view of this, including cropland and grasslandmanagement into accounting of emissions would be a necessary step towards thefull recognition of the contribution of these activities to meet the climatechallenge commitments.

Forestry also has much potential toboost mitigation. This includes practices such asconverting non-forest land to forest (i.e. afforestation)[9], avoiding the conversion offorest to other types of land (i.e. deforestation), storing carbon in existingforests through longer rotation periods of trees, avoiding clear-felling (e.g.forest management on thinning or selective logging) and conversion toundisturbed forests, and more widespread use of prevention measures to limitthe impacts of disturbances such as fires, pests and storms. Equallyimportantly, existing forests can be made more productive by spacing rotationscloser to the productive maximum, producing more from low-production forestsand increasing the harvest of timber off-cuts and branch-wood, providedbiodiversity, soil fertility and organic matter can be maintained. An impactcould also be obtained by changing species composition and growth rates.

In addition to the opportunities directlylinked to forestry and agriculture, there are potential mitigation benefits inthe related industries (e.g. pulp and paper, wood processing) andrenewable energy sectors if agricultural land and forests are managed forproduction of timber and energy. Whilst carbon is stored in trees and in otherplants and soils, it can also be stored for several decades in products (e.g.construction wood). Industry and consumer oriented policies can make animportant contribution to increasing the long termuse and recycling of wood and/or the production of pulp, paper and woodproducts, thereby replacing more emission-intensive equivalents (e.g. concrete,steel, plastics made from fossil fuels). In fact, the bio-based industrycan make use of crops grown for material substitution (e.g. hemp and grass forinsulation instead of glass fibre, straw for furniture production, car doorpanels made from flax or sisal plants, bio-plastics) or for energy (e.g. usingbiomass instead of fossil fuels). Studies show that for each tonne of carbon inwood products substituted for non-wood products an average greenhouse gasemission reduction of approximately two tonnes of carbon can be expected[10].

The inclusion of mandatoryaccounting for forest management, cropland management and grazing-landmanagement would make action taken by farmers, foresters and forest-basedindustries more apparent and provide the basis for designing policy incentivesto increase their mitigation action. If such efforts are being accounted for,their overall greenhouse gas impact is more correctly reflected and thecost-efficiency of reaching emission reduction targets would be improved.

Given the fact that agricultural land use,forestry and related industries differ greatly between Member States in termsof their emission potential within the Union no single policy approach will fitthem all. A tailored approach is needed to tackle the different forms of landuses and forestry practices. The fundamental pre-condition for protecting andenhancing carbon stocks, and the rate of removals is the provision of a levelplaying field between different types of measures in the various sectors in theMember States (e.g. grazing land management or bio-energy production), throughaccurate and harmonised accounting for emissions and removals from the LULUCFsector.

Current policies are not enough

Although the LULUCFsector does not yet count towards the Union’s emission reduction target for2020, it counts in part towards the Union’s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol(‘Kyoto Protocol’) to the UNFCCC, approved by Council Decision 2002/358/EC [11] for the periodfrom 2008 to 2012. However, the existing international accounting rules, whichare a mix of voluntary and mandatory practices, have significant drawbacks.Most importantly, accounting is voluntary for most LULUCF activities, notablyfor forest management (representing about 70 % of the sector) and for croplandand grazing-land management (representing about 17 % of the sector). As aresult, accounting in this first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocolvaries greatly between Member States. Another drawback is the lack ofincentives for climate change mitigation in forestry. Improvements inaccounting are necessary to create a level playing field within theagricultural, forestry and related industries and energy sectors in the MemberStates with a view to ensuring their consistent treatment within the Union’sinternal market.

Robust and harmonisedestimation of emissions and removals in agriculture and forestry requiresinvestment in monitoring and reporting capacity. Nonetheless, there are stillsignificant gaps and the accuracy and completeness of the reported data must beimproved, especially as regards data on agricultural soils. Improvements inmonitoring and reporting will therefore not only support accounting butalso provide a robust, clear and visible indicator of progress in agricultureand forestry.

Fostering synergieswith wider policy objectives isalso important. Incentives do exist to promote the use of bio-energy[12] but currentlythere is no coherent approach to climate change mitigation in the LULUCF sectorthrough measures in agriculture, forestry and related industries.

Indeed, climate change mitigation could play anincreasingly important role in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In thepost-2013 Union rural-development policy, climate change mitigation andadaptation could be tackled by offering better incentives for carbonsequestration in agriculture and forestry. Some of them would at the same timeenhance and protect carbon stocks and generate co-benefits for biodiversity andfor adaptation by increasing water-retention capacity and reducing erosion.Mandatory accounting of associated carbon fluxes would make the positivecontribution of these measures more visible and ensure their full contributiontowards meeting the climate change challenge. Accounting for LULUCF would alsoclarify the benefits of sustainable bio-energy by better reflecting relatedemissions, in particular those resulting from the combustion of biomass, whichis unaccounted for at the moment. This would strengthen the incentives providedby sustainability criteria in the context of renewable energy targets.

However, LULUCF is not like other sectors.Removals and emissions of greenhouse gases in this sector are the result ofrelatively slow natural processes. It can take decades before measures such asafforestation have a significant effect. Therefore, action to increase removalsand reduce emissions in forestry and agriculture should be considered over thelong-term. Moreover, emissions and removals are reversible: such reversals maybe because extreme events such as fires, storms, droughts or pests have had animpact on forest and land cover or because of management decisions (e.g. toharvest or plant trees). In addition, annual fluctuations of emissionsand removals in forests are high and can amount to as much as 35 % of thetotal annual emissions in some Member States as a result of naturaldisturbances and harvesting. This would make it difficult for Member States tocomply with annual targets.

Although emissions and removals from LULUCFare reported under the UNFCCC and partially accounted under the Kyoto Protocol,the sector was left out of the Union’s climate commitments under the Climateand Energy Package due to the recognition of serious deficiencies ininternational accounting rules of emissions and removals from this sector. Also,the expectation at the moment of setting the Union emission reduction targetwas that the climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 would deliver aninternational agreement on climate change, including revised accounting rulesfor LULUCF, which could then be adopted by the Union. This did not happen onthat occasion.

However, during the 17thConference of the Parties of the UNFCCC serving as the meeting of the Partiesto the Kyoto Protocol in Durban in December 2011 progress was made. In thisframework, Decision -/CMP.7 sets out the rules, definitions and modalities foraccounting for the LULUCF sector as of a second commitment period under theKyoto Protocol. In particular, accounting for forest management activities,including for harvested wood products, will be mandatory and definitions fornatural disturbances and wetland drainage and rewetting were established.Therefore, it is important to proceed at Union level in parallel with theinternational processes. A legal proposal on accounting for emissions andremovals from activities related to LULUCF in the Union needs to be in linewith the decisions taken at international level in order to ensure theappropriate level of coherence; at the same time, however, it should give theUnion a chance to lead by example with a view to an international agreement asof a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.

The aim of this proposal is therefore togradually integrate the LULUCF sector into the Union’s climate policy by meansof a separate legal framework which addresses the sector’s specific profile andby ensuring a robust and harmonised accounting framework. Most importantly, itwould complete the accounting of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions fromall economic activities within the Union. As part of that it would increase thevisibility of ongoing and new mitigation efforts in agriculture, forestry andrelated industries and provide a basis for designing adequate policy incentives(e.g. in the CAP and in view of the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe[13]). Laying down common Unionaccounting rules would also level the playing field among Member States. Itwould capture the changes in carbon stocks due to the use of domesticallyproduced biomass, thus completing the accounting of bio-energy at the level ofthe economy. This would strengthen the environmental integrity of the Union’sclimate policy. Lastly, it would be an important and necessary move towards acost effective pursuit of more ambitious climate targets. To this end, it istherefore important to establish robust and harmonised accounting rules for thesector and to ensure their contribution towards meeting the climate changechallenges.

2.           RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONSWITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

Consultations with stakeholders

In early 2010, an expert group on climatepolicy for LULUCF was established under the European Climate Change Programme. Thegroup comprised a wide range of stakeholders: environmental NGOs, tradeassociations, experts from public administrations and researchers. The group’sobjective was to define and provide input on critical issues related to theinclusion of the LULUCF sector in the Union’s climate change mitigationefforts. This helped define the scope and steer the work of the Commission. Thesummary report with the main findings is available on the relevant Commissionwebsites[14].

An online public consultation was carriedout in 2010 to collect views on the opportunities and challenges related to theinclusion of the LULUCF sector in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reductioncommitments[15].A total of 153 responses were received, representing the views of privatecompanies, business and industry organisations, individuals and private landowners, non-governmental organisations, academia and research, and publicauthorities. The same questions were subsequently used in a separateconsultation with Member States and 14 responses were received. The followingpoints can be made based on the data collected through the online publicconsultation:

·                        most of the respondents believe that land useactivities could contribute to mitigating climate change even in the short term(until 2020) and in the longer term between 2020 and 2050;

·                        the majority replied that the LULUCF sectorshould be part of the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for2020, with a tendency in favour of including the sector only if the Union wereto take on a more ambitious commitment;

·                        respondents tended to favour a separateaccounting framework for the LULUCF sector, as opposed to inclusion in the EUETS or ESD;

·                        the majority of respondents also agreed thatthere is a need for more harmonisation and standardisation in reporting andmonitoring within the Union;

·                        the vast majority of respondents considered theexisting Union and national policies to be insufficient to ensure that land useactivities contribute to climate change mitigation.

The full results of the online publicconsultation and the consultation with Member States are available on therelevant Commission websites[16].

Finally, the Commission also held astakeholder meeting on 28 January 2011 in Brussels. Around 75 participantsrepresenting Member States, trade associations, environmental NGOs and researchinstitutes took part in the discussions. The proceedings are also available onthe relevant Commission websites[17].

Impact assessment

The impact assessment investigated threekey issues that need to be addressed when assessing how LULUCF should beincluded in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments, namelyhow to:

·                        ensure robust accounting rules for emissions andremovals;

·                        achieve robust monitoring and reporting;

·                        establish the appropriate policy context forbringing the sector into the Union’s climate change commitments.

Based on the policy context for includingthe sector in the Union’s commitments currently regulated by the ESD and the EUETS, the impact assessment considered three options for including LULUCF,namely as part of the ESD, as a separate framework or by delaying inclusionaltogether. Each option addressed the issues of accounting and monitoring. Thepotential social, economic and environmental impacts of the various optionswere considered in detail.

The impact assessment concluded that there were goodreasons to include LULUCF in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission-reductioncommitments, namely to improve their policy coherence, environmental integrityand economic efficiency. But this will only be possible if the right policycontext for LULUCF is put in place. The high variability of emissions andremovals in forests means that annual emission reduction targets of the kind thatapply to other sectors are unsuitable. The long lead times needed formitigation measures to take effect also set LULUCF apart from most othersectors. In view of this, the impact assessment indicated that a separatelegal framework for LULUCF would be the preferred option. In terms ofaccounting, the suitable options identified included mandatory accounting ofemissions and removals from both forestry and agricultural activities andgiving equal weight to mitigation action irrespective of whether it was takenin the forestry, agriculture, related industries or energy sectors. This is morecost-efficient and will ensure a level playing field not only for Member Statesbut also for the various sectors of the Union’s internal market. It will alsoprovide a framework of incentives for mitigation action by farmers, forestersand related industries, ensuring that such action is visible and correctly recorded.Broad coverage of emissions and removals will also ensure that potentialreversals are reflected in the accounting system. Mitigation actions should neverthelessnot be put on hold. National action plans could be prepared to provide astrategy and forecast for LULUCF. This would be an intermediate step towardsthe sector’s full integration into current policies. Moreover, the impactassessment also indicated that monitoring and reporting needed to be improvedto underpin the accounting framework and the indicators tracking progress inagriculture and forestry. The Commission proposes to achieve this through aseparate framework, namely by revising the Monitoring Mechanism Decision. Forreasons of comparability and cost-efficiency, better use could also be made ofUnion-wide monitoring instruments such as LUCAS and CORINE.

The full results are presented in theimpact assessment accompanying the proposal.

Summary of the proposal

The mainobjective of this Decision is to establish robust and comprehensive accountingrules for LULUCF as well as to enable future policy development towards thefull inclusion of LULUCF in the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reductioncommitments when the conditions are right. To this end this Decisionestablishes a framework for:

·                        a mandatory accounting obligation on MemberStates as regards greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinksassociated with agricultural and forestry activities in the LULUCF sector andvoluntary accounting for revegetation and wetland drainage and rewetting;

·                        the general accounting rules that must beapplied;

·                        the specific accounting rules for afforestation,reforestation, deforestation, forest management, changes in the harvested woodproducts pool, cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation, andwetland drainage and rewetting;

·                        the specific rules for accounting for naturaldisturbances;

·                        adopting LULUCF Action Plans in Member Statesdesigned to limit or reduce emissions by sources and maintain or increaseremovals by sinks associated with LULUCF activities, and for the evaluation ofthose plans by the Commission;

·                        the Commission’s power to update the definitionslaid down in Article 2 in the light of changes to definitions adopted by thebodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol or other multilateral agreementrelevant to climate change concluded by the Union, to amend Annex I to addaccounting periods and ensure consistency between those accounting periods andthe relevant periods applicable to Union emission reduction commitments inother sectors, to amend Annex II with updated reference levels in accordancewith the proposed reference levels submitted by Member States pursuant toArticle 6 subject to corrections made in accordance with this Decision, torevise the information specified in Annex III in accordance with scientificprogress and to revise the conditions relating to the accounting rules fornatural disturbances laid down in Article 9(2) in the light of scientificprogress or to reflect revisions to acts adopted by UNFCCC or Kyoto Protocolbodies.

3.           LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THEPROPOSAL

Legal basis

The legal basis for the legislativeproposal is Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EuropeanUnion. The proposal pursues a legitimate objective within the scope of Article191(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, namely,combating climate change. The purpose of the legislative proposal is to ensureMember States’ accurate and consistent accounting of emissions by sources andremovals by sinks related to LULUCF, and therefore to improve the availabilityof information for policy and decision making in the context of the Union’sclimate change commitments and provide incentives for mitigation efforts. Thisobjective cannot be achieved by less restrictive means than the legislativeproposal.

Subsidiarity principle

For Union action to be justified, thesubsidiarity principle must be respected.

(a)                   Transnational nature of the problem (necessitytest)

Climate change is a trans-boundary issuewhich requires joint action by Member States. Nationalactions alone would not achieve compliance with the commongreenhouse gas emission reduction targets set at Union’slevel; they would also neither meet the objectives nor fulfil internationallyagreed commitments. It is therefore necessary for the Union to create anenabling legal framework to ensure harmonised accounting for the LULUCF sectorwherever possible in order to further its contributionto the climate change commitments of the Union.

(b)                   Effectiveness test (added value)

By reason of its effectiveness, takingaction at Union level would produce clear benefits compared to action at MemberState level. As the overarching climate change commitments are made at theUnion level, it is effective to also develop the required accounting rules atthis level. Moreover, overcoming the problems that have been identified, suchas the need to have accurate and consistent accountingmethodologies for the different LULUCF activities,requires common rules across all Member States. This can be ensured only at theUnion level.

This legal framework will ensureeffectiveness by employing harmonised and sound accounting and LULUCF ActionPlans, and by enabling a more detailed assessment and evaluation of progress inMember States. This will ensure the coherence of the Union’s climate policy,further improve the environmental integrity of the Union’s climate changecommitments and enhance the economic efficiency of the Union’s climate policy.

Proportionality principle

The proposal complies with theproportionality principle for the following reasons:

It does not go beyond what is necessary inorder to achieve the objectives of improving climate change data quality andensuring compliance with international and Union requirements and commitments.

The proposal is proportionate to the Union’soverall objective of reaching the Union targets enshrined in the Climate andEnergy Package, the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord and the Decisions1/CP.16, 1/CMP.6 and 2/CMP.6 (‘Cancun Agreements’).

The proposal provides for theimplementation of accounting rules which are similar to, but more robust andcomprehensive than, the ones discussed and employed at international level,especially with regard to Decision -/CMP.7.

4.           BUDGETARY IMPLICATION

As specified in the financial statementaccompanying this Decision, the Decision will be implemented using the existingbudget and will not have an impact on the multi-annual financial framework.

5.           OPTIONAL ELEMENTS

The proposal includes a provision pursuantto which the Commission will review the accounting rules in this Decision atthe latest within one year of the end of the first accounting period.

2012/0042 (COD)

Proposal for a

DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTAND OF THE COUNCIL

on accounting rules and action plans ongreenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities related to landuse, land use change and forestry

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THECOUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from theEuropean Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislativeact to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of theEuropean Economic and Social Committee[18],

Having regard to the opinion of theCommittee of the Regions[19],

Acting in accordance with the ordinarylegislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1) The Union land use, land use change and forestry (‘LULUCF’) sector is a net sink that removes from the atmosphere greenhouse gasses in an amount equivalent to a significant share of total Union emissions. It results in anthropogenic emissions and removals of greenhouse gases as a consequence of changes in the quantity of carbon stored in vegetation and soils. The increased sustainable use of harvested wood products can substantially limit emissions and enhance removals from the atmosphere. Emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from the LULUCF sector are not counted towards the Union's 20 % greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2020 pursuant to Decision No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the efforts of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community's greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020 and Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC, though they count in part towards the Union's quantified emission limitation and reduction target pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Kyoto Protocol (‘Kyoto Protocol’) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘UNFCCC’), approved by Council Decision 2002/358/EC.

(1a) In accordance with the Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050', it is necessary to consider all land uses in a holistic manner and to address LULUCF within the Union's climate policy.

(2) Article 9 of Decision No 406/2009/EC requires the Commission to assess modalities to include greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities related to land use, land use change and forestry into the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitment, whilst ensuring the permanence and environmental integrity of the contribution of the sector, and providing for accurate monitoring and accounting of the relevant emissions and removals. This Decision should, therefore, as a first step, set out accounting rules applicable to greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector. To ensure the preservation and enhancement of carbon stocks in the interim, it should also provide for Member States to adopt LULUCF Action Plans as a separate document or, where available, as part of their low-carbon development strategies to limit or reduce emissions, and to maintain or increase removals, from the LULUCF sector.

(2a) This Decision lays down the obligations of Member States in implementing those accounting rules and action plans. It does not lay down any accounting or reporting obligations for private parties including farmers and foresters.

(3) The 17th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, meeting in Durban in December 2011, adopted Decision 2/CMP.7 of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol ('Decision 2/CMP.7') and Decision 16/CMP.1. Those decisions set out rules for accounting for the LULUCF sector as of a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. This Decision should be fully consistent with those decisions to ensure coherence between the Union's internal rules and methodologies agreed within the UNFCCC to avoid any duplication of national reporting. This Decision should also reflect the particularities of the Union LULUCF sector and the obligations arising from the Union as a separate Party.

(3a) The accounting rules applicable to the Union LULUCF sector should not generate an additional administrative burden, therefore the reports submitted in accordance with those rules should not be required to include information that is not required pursuant to the decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol;

(4) The accounts for LULUCF activities should reflect efforts made in the agriculture and forestry sectors to enhance the contribution of changes made to the use of land resources to the reduction of emissions. This Decision should provide for accounts for LULUCF activities applicable on a mandatory basis to the forestry activities of afforestation, reforestation, deforestation and forest management, to the agricultural activities of grazing land management and cropland management, as well as of wetland drainage and rewetting within one year after publication of relevant IPCCC guidance. It should also provide for accounting rules applicable on a voluntary basis to revegetation.

(5) To ensure the environmental integrity of the accounting rules applicable to the Union LULUCF sector, these rules should be based on the accounting principles laid down in Decision 2/CMP.7, Decision 2/CMP.6 and Decision 16/CMP.1 of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and applied in a consistent, comparable and complete manner within the Union and among Member States.


(5a) Accounting rules based on Decision 2/CMP.7, and Decision 16/CMP.1 do not allow for accounting of the substitution effect of using harvested wood products for energy and material purposes, since this would lead to double accounting. However, those are important contributions of forestry to climate change mitigation. For that reason, and for informative purposes, Member States may calculate emissions avoided through substitution effects of forest management. This would increase policy coherence.

(6) The accounting rules should accurately represent human-induced changes in emissions and removals. In that regard, this Decision should provide for the use of specific methodologies in respect of different LULUCF activities. Emissions and removals related to afforestation, reforestation and deforestation are the direct result of human intervention and should therefore be accounted for in their entirety. However, given that not all emissions and removals from forest management are anthropogenic, the relevant accounting rules should provide for the use of reference levels to exclude the effects of natural and country-specific characteristics. Reference levels constitute estimates of the annual net emissions or removals resulting from forest management within the territory of a Member State for the years included in an accounting period, and should be set transparently in accordance with Decision 2/CMP.7. They should be synchronised with the UNFCCC decisions and they should be updated only if the reference levels adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol are updated. The accounting rules should provide for an upper limit applicable to net greenhouse gas emissions and removals for forest management that may be entered into accounts, given underlying uncertainties in the projections on which the reference levels are based. It is the intention of the Union to replace the current reference level approach with a more comprehensive approach in the next accounting period and to adapt this Decision accordingly.

(6a) The accounting rules should appropriately reflect the positive contribution of greenhouse gas storage in wood and wood-based products and should contribute to greater use of forests as a resource, within a framework of sustainable forest management, and to increased use of wood products.

(7) The accounting rules for forest management should ensure that Member States accurately reflect in accounts the time emissions of greenhouse gasses from harvested wood take place, to provide incentives for the use of harvested wood products with long life cycles. The first-order decay function applicable to emissions resulting from harvested wood products should therefore correspond to equation 12.1 of the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ('IPCC') Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and the relevant default half-life values should be based on Table 3a.1.3 of the 2003 IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry. The Union should elaborate sustainability criteria for biomass for energy imported from third countries.

(8)              Since inter-annual fluctuations in greenhousegas emissions and removals resulting from agricultural activities are muchsmaller than those related to forestry activities, Member States should accountfor greenhouse gas emissions and removals from cropland and grazing landmanagement activities relative to its base year in accordance with theirreviewed initial report on base year emission data as submitted to the UNFCCC pursuantto Decision 13/CMP.1 of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting ofthe Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (‘Decision 13/CMP.1’).

(8a) Wetland drainage and rewetting cover emissions from peatlands storing very large amounts of carbon. Emissions from degrading and draining peatlands correspond to some 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and represented 3,5-4% of Union's emissions in 2010. In order to have full transparency and to show leadership in a sector where the Union is the second largest emitter globally, emissions and removals from wetland drainage and rewetting should also be included in Member States' accounts.

(9) Natural disturbances, such as wildfires, insect and disease infestations, extreme weather events and geological disturbances that are beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, a Member State, may result in greenhouse gas emissions or reductions of a temporary nature in the LULUCF sector, or may cause the reversal of previous removals. As reversal can also be the result of management decisions, such as decisions to harvest or plant trees, this Decision should ensure that human-induced reversals of removals are always accurately reflected in LULUCF accounts. Moreover, this Decision should provide Member States a limited possibility to exclude emissions resulting from disturbances in afforestation, reforestation and forest management that are beyond their control from their LULUCF accounts through the use of background levels and margins in accordance with Decision 2/CMP.7.

(10) Reporting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and other information relevant to climate change, including information on the LULUCF sector, fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) No.../... [Commission proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting Union greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other information at national and Union level relevant to climate change (COM/2011/0789 final — 2011/0372 (COD)], and should be considered by Member States when monitoring and reporting, although they do not fall within the scope of this Decision.

(11)          Inter-annual fluctuations in emissions andremovals, the frequent need to recalculate certain reported data, and long timerequired for changed management practices in agriculture and forestry to havean effect on the quantity of carbon stored in vegetation and soils would makeLULUCF sector accounts inaccurate and unreliable if compiled on an annualbasis. This Decision should therefore provide for longer and more appropriateaccounting periods.

(12) Member State LULUCF Action Plans should set out nationally appropriate measures to limit or reduce emissions and to maintain or increase removals from the LULUCF sector. Each LULUCF Action Plan should contain certain information as specified in this Decision. Moreover, to promote best practice, an indicative list of measures that may also be included in those plans should be set out in Annex to this Decision. The Commission should provide guidance and adopt structural guidelines for the preparation of those Plans, and an ad hoc working group of national experts shall be constituted in order to evaluate the implementation of Member States’ LULUCF Action Plans together with the Commission. Where appropriate, the Commission may issue practicable recommendations to enhance Member State action. Participation of the public during the preparation, modification and review of these plans should be provided for in this Decision.

(13) The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to update the definitions laid down in this Decision in the light of changes to definitions adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol or other multilateral agreements relevant to climate change concluded by the Union, to amend Annex I to add accounting periods and ensure consistency between those accounting periods and the relevant periods adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC, or other multilateral agreement relevant to climate change concluded by the Union, to amend Annex II with updated reference levels in accordance with the proposed reference levels submitted by Member States subject to corrections made in accordance with this Decision and in the light of changes to reference levels approved by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol, to revise the information specified in Annex III in accordance with scientific progress and in the light of changes adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol or other successor frameworks and to revise the conditions relating to the accounting rules for natural disturbances laid down in this Decision in the light of scientific progress or to reflect revisions to acts adopted by the UNFCCC or Kyoto Protocol bodies. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. Delegated acts should be adopted, safeguarding the European Parliament's right to object.

 

(13a) The Commission should examine whether, in drawing up and implementing the action plans on greenhouse gas removals, there is potential for promoting agricultural investment.

(14) Since the objectives of the proposed action cannot, by their very nature, be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can therefore by reason of scale and effects of the action be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. LULUCF-issues, such as forest policy, are under Member States' competence. The Union should not intervene in relation to national forest policies and should respect the competence of Member States in this field. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

Article 1

Subjectmatter and scope

This Decision sets out accounting rules for Member States applicable to emissions and removals resulting from land use, land use change and forestry activities. This Decision does not lay down accounting or reporting obligations for private parties. It also provides for Member States LULUCF Action Plans to limit or reduce emissions and maintain or increase removals.

(g)         ‘cropland management’ is any activity resultingfrom a system of practices applicable to land on which agricultural crops aregrown and on land that is set aside or temporarily not being used for cropproduction;

(h)         ‘grazing land management’ is any activityresulting from a system of practices applicable to land used for livestockproduction and aimed at controlling or influencing the quantity and type ofvegetation and livestock produced;

(i)           ‘revegetation’ is any direct human-inducedactivity intended to increase the carbon stock of any site that covers aminimum area of 0.05 hectares, through the proliferation of vegetation, wherethat activity does not constitute afforestation or reforestation;

(j) ‘carbon stock’ is the quantity of the element carbon stored in a carbon pool;

(k)         ‘wetland drainage and rewetting’ is any activityresulting from a system for draining or rewetting land that covers a minimumarea of 1 hectare and on which organic soil is present, provided the activitydoes not constitute any other activity referred to in Article 3(1), and wheredraining is the direct human-induced lowering of the soil water table, andrewetting is the direct human-induced partial or total reversal of drainage;

(l)           ‘source’ is any process, activity or mechanismthat releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor to a greenhouse gasinto the atmosphere;

All approaches shall avoid the expectation of net credits during the commitment period. If a Member State's forest management reference level does not include a background level of emissions, for the application of the background as referred to in Article 9(2), a value for the background level shall be estimated by applying the first approach mentioned above. Where the background level is defined as above, the margin would be equal twice the standard deviation on the time series defining the background level. In the case that the background level is defined using the country-specific approach or the Member State's reference level is zero, the Member State must describe how a margin is established, where a margin is needed. All approaches should avoid the expectation of net credits during the commitment period.

2. Emissions and removals resulting from any activity falling within one or more categories of activity referred to in Article 3(1) shall only be accounted for under one category to prevent double counting.

3.                      Member States shall, on the basis of transparentand verifiable data, determine the areas of land on which an activity fallingwithin a category referred to in Article 3(1) is conducted. They shall ensurethat all such areas of land are identifiable with precision in the account forthe respective category.

4.                      Member States shall include in their accountsreferred to in Article 3(1) any change in the carbon stock of the followingcarbon pools:

However, Member States may choose not toinclude in their accounts changes in carbon stock for carbon pools listed underpoints (a) — (e) of the first subparagraph where the carbon pool is not adeclining sink or a source. Member States shall only consider that a carbonpool is not a declining sink or a source where this is demonstrated on thebasis of transparent and verifiable data.

Member States shall make any technical corrections and recalculations necessary to include in their existing and newly established accounts, where otherwise excluded, the carbon pools referred to in this paragraph, and greenhouse gases referred to in Article 3(2).

5.                      Member States shall complete their accountsreferred to in Article 3(1) at the end of each accounting period listed inAnnex I by specifying the total emissions and total removals included in thoseaccounts during that accounting period.

6.                      Member States shall maintain a complete andaccurate record of all methodologies and data used in complying with theirobligations under this Decision.

7. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 12 to amend Annex I to add accounting periods if necessary so as to ensure consistency between those accounting periods and the relevant periods adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol within the framework of the UNFCCC, or other multilateral agreement relevant to climate change concluded by the Union.

Article 5

Accounting rules for afforestation, reforestation and deforestation

1. In accounts relating to reforestation, Member States shall reflect emissions and removals resulting only from such activities taking place on those lands that were not forest on 31 December 1989.

2.                      Where Member States reflect in their accountsnet changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and removals resultingfrom afforestation, reforestation and deforestation activities, such netchanges shall represent the total removals and emissions for the years in each accountingperiod specified in Annex I, calculated by summing up for each year of thataccounting period the carbon stock on 31 December of that year minus the carbonstock on 1 January in the same year, on the basis of transparent and verifiabledata.

3. Member States shall account for methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation activities. Such emissions shall represent the total emissions for the years in each accounting period specified in Annex I, calculated by summing up the emissions occurring in each year in that accounting period, on the basis of transparent and verifiable data.

4. Member States shall maintain accounts for emissions and removals on lands that have been identified in accounts pursuant to Article 4(3) under afforestation, reforestation and deforestation even where such activity is no longer conducted on that land.

5.                      Member States shall use the same spatialassessment unit in calculations to determine the forest falling withinafforestation, reforestation and deforestation.

Article 6

Accounting rules for forest management

1. Member States shall account for emissions and removals resulting from forest management activities, calculated as emissions and removals in each accounting period specified in Annex I, minus the value obtained by multiplying the number of years in that accounting period by their reference level specified in Annex II.

2. Where the result of the calculation referred to in paragraph 1 for an accounting period is negative, Member States shall enter into their forest management accounts total emissions and removals of no more than the equivalent of 3.5 per cent of a Member State’s emissions in its base year or base period, as submitted to the UNFCCC in that Member State’s reviewed initial report on base year emission data pursuant to the Annex of Decision 13/CMP.1, excluding emissions and removals from activities referred to in Article 3(1), multiplied by the number of years in that accounting period.

3. Member States shall ensure that the calculation methods they apply in respect of their accounts for forest management activities are in accordance with Appendix II of Decision 2/CMP.6 and consistent with the calculation methods applied for the calculation of their reference levels specified in Annex II with regards to the following aspects:

(a)                   carbon pools and greenhouse gases;

(b)                   area under forest management;

(d)                   natural disturbances.

4. Reference levels for forest management shall be identical to those established by acts approved by the UNFCCC or Kyoto bodies. No later than one year before the end of each accounting period, Member States shall communicate to the Commission revised reference levels for the following accounting period in accordance with the process and methodology in Decisions 2/CMP.6 and 2/CMP.7 used for calculating the reference levels set out in Decision 2/CMP.7.

For the period after 2020 comprehensive land-based accounting shall be used.

5. If there are changes to the relevant provisions of Decision 2/CMP.6 or Decision 2/CMP.7, the Member States shall communicate to the Commission revised reference levels reflecting those changes no later than six months after the adoption of those changes.

6. If improved methodologies become available allowing a Member State to calculate reference levels in a significantly more accurate manner or where there are significant improvements in the quality of data available to a Member State, the Member State concerned shall carry out a technical adjustment following the provisions of Decision 2/CMP.7 and shall communicate to the Commission revised reference levels reflecting those changes without delay.

7. For the purposes of paragraphs 4, 5 and 6, Member States shall specify the amount of annual emissions resulting from natural disturbances which have been included in their revised reference levels and the manner in which they estimated that amount.

8. The Commission shall use revised reference levels as defined in the UNFCCC process.
For the purposes of paragraph 4, and in the absence of specific acts adopted by the UNFCCC or Kyoto bodies or other successor frameworks establishing forest management reference levels, the Commission shall verify the accuracy of new reference levels.

9. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 12 to update the reference levels in Annex II, in the light of changes to the references levels approved by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol.

10.                  Member States shall reflect in their accountsfor forest management the impact of any amendment to Annex II in respect ofentire relevant accounting period.

10a. No later than six months before submitting the Union position to the UNFCCC, the Commission shall conduct consultations with Member States, as appropriate, so as to ensure completeness in its submission.



Article 7

Accounting rules for harvested wood products

1. Harvested wood products as such shall not be considered as emissions of greenhouse gas. Member States shall reflect in their accounts pursuant to Article 3(1) emissions from harvested wood products containing carbon on 1 January 2013 even where such harvested wood products were harvested prior to this date and shall distinguish between products originating from deforestation and forest management.

2.                      In accounts pursuant to Article 3(1) relating toharvested wood products, Member States shall reflect emissions resulting fromthe following harvested wood products on the basis of calculations inaccordance with the first order decay function and the default half-life valuesspecified in Annex III:

(a)         paper;

(b)         wood panels;

(c)         sawn wood.

Member States may use country-specific half-life values instead of the half-life values specified in Annex III provided that those values are determined by the Member State on the basis of transparent and verifiable data, and that they are at least as detailed as those in Annex III.

Imported harvest wood products irrespective of their origin, shall not be accounted for by the importing Member State.

In accounts relating to exported harvested wood products, Member States may use country-specific half-life values instead of the half-life values specified in Annex III, provided that those values are determined by the Member State on the basis of transparent and verifiable data on the use of those harvested wood products in the importing country and that they are at least as detailed or accurate as those in Annex III.

Member States electing to use country-specific half life values for exported harvest wood products shall notify the Commission one year prior to the end of the accounting period for review and approval.

Member States shall not use country-specific half-life values for harvest wood products placed on the market in the Union that deviate from those used by the importing Member State in their accounts under Article 3(1).

Member States shall account for emissions resulting from harvest wood products resulting from deforestation on the basis of instantaneous oxidation.



3.                      Where Member States reflect in their accountspursuant to Article 3(1) carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fromharvested wood products in solid waste disposal sites, they shall do so on thebasis of the instantaneous oxidation method.

4. Member States shall reflect in their accounts emissions resulting from harvested wood products that were imported or harvested for energy purposes, they shall do so also on the basis of the instantaneous oxidation method.

Member States shall track harvested wood products that were harvested outside the Union and that are used for energy purposes within the Member State, for the purpose of providing a summary of emissions while indicating the country of harvest of the harvested wood product and whether it was harvested in a sustainable manner. For informative purposes the emissions avoided through the use of this biomass may be calculated.

5.                      A Member State shall reflect emissions fromharvested wood products in its accounts only where these emissions result fromharvested wood products removed from lands included in the accounts of thatMember State pursuant to Article 3(1).

6. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 12 to revise the information specified in Annex III in accordance with scientific progress and in the light of changes adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol or other successor frameworks.

Article 8

Accountingrules for cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation, andwetland drainage and rewetting

1.                      In accounts relating to cropland management andgrazing land management, Member States shall reflect emissions and removalsresulting from such activities, calculated as emissions and removals in eachaccounting period specified in Annex I, minus the value obtained by multiplyingthe number of years in that accounting period by a Member State’s emissions andremovals resulting from such activities in its base year, as submitted to the UNFCCCin that Member State’s reviewed initial report on base year emission datapursuant to the Annex of Decision 13/CMP.1.

2.                      Where a Member State elects to draw up andmaintain accounts for revegetation, and/or wetland drainage and rewetting, it shallapply the calculation method specified in paragraph 1.

In accounts relating to wetland drainage andrewetting, Member States shall reflect emissions and removals resulting fromthat activity on all lands that have been drained since 1990 and all lands thathave been rewetted since 1990.

Article 9

Accounting rules for natural disturbances

1. Where the conditions set out in paragraph 3 are met, Member States may exclude non-anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources resulting from natural disturbances from calculations relevant to their accounting obligations pursuant to points (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) of Article 3(1). If Member States exclude such emissions they shall also exclude any subsequent removals on lands where those natural disturbances have occurred. However, non-anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources resulting from natural disturbances which have been included in the calculation of their reference level pursuant to Article 6(4), Article 6(5) or Article 6(6) shall not be excluded.

1a. For afforestation and reforestation activities referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 3(1), Member States shall calculate a background level of emissions from natural disturbances. In accordance with Decision 2/CMP.7 Member States may exclude either annually or at the end of the accounting period referred to in Annex I, emissions from natural disturbances that any in single year exceed the afforestation and deforestation background level plus the margin.

1b For forest management activities referred to in point (d) of Article 3(1), Member States may exclude from the accounting, either annually, or are at the end of second commitment period, emissions from natural disturbances that in any single year exceed the forest management background level, plus margin, where a margin is needed.

2. Member States may exclude non-anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources in accordance with paragraph 1 from calculations relevant to their accounting obligations pursuant to points (a), (b) and (d) of Article 3(1).

Member States shall, assisted by the Commission where appropriate, make any technical corrections or recalculations to their forest management reference level specified in Annex II, to include, if not otherwise included in conformity with this paragraph, the background level of emissions associated with annual natural disturbances.

2a. Member States shall calculate the net emissions and removals subject to paragraph 2 and shall provide transparent information:

 

(a) showing that all lands subject to exclusion are identified, including by their georeferenced location, year and types of natural disturbances;

 

(b) showing how annual emissions resulting from natural disturbances and the subsequent removals in those areas are estimated;

 

(c) showing that no land-use change has occurred on the lands for which exclusion is applied and explaining the methods and criteria for identifying any future land-use changes on those land areas during the accounting period.

 

(d) demonstrating that the occurrences were beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, the Member State in the accounting period, by demonstrating practicable efforts to prevent, manage or control the occurrences for which exclusions is claimed.

 

(e) demonstrating efforts taken to rehabilitate, where practicable, the land for which exclusion is claimed.

 

(f) showing that emissions associated with salvage logging, were not excluded from accounting.

 

Member States shall not exclude from accounting emissions from natural disturbances on those lands that are subject to land-use change following the disturbance.

3.                      Member States may also separately excludenon-anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources in accordance withparagraph 1 from calculations relevant to their accounting obligations pursuantto points (e) and (f) of Article 3(1) where those non-anthropogenic greenhousegas emissions from such natural disturbances in a single year exceed 5 per centof the total emissions of a Member State in its base year as submitted to theUNFCCC in that Member State’s reviewed initial report on base year emissiondata pursuant to the Annex of Decision 13/CMP.1 excluding emissions andremovals from activities referred to in Article 3(1), provided that conditions stipulatedin Article 9(2) are met.

4.                      Member States shall include in their accountsreferred to in Article 3(1) emissions resulting from harvested wood productsrecovered by salvage logging in accordance with Article 7.

5. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 12 to revise the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 in the light of scientific progress or to reflect revisions to acts adopted by UNFCCC or Kyoto Protocol bodies.


Article 10

LULUCFAction Plans

1. No later than one year after the beginning of each accounting period specified in Annex I, Member States shall draw up and transmit to the Commission LULUCF Action Plans as a separate document or where available as a clearly identifiable part of their national Low-carbon Development Strategies, to limit or reduce emissions and maintain or increase removals resulting from the activities referred to in Article 3(1). Member States shall ensure that a broad range of stakeholders are consulted.

Member States shall conform to these guidelines and the Commission may ask a Member State to modify or supplement these Plans to ensure that they comply with the guidelines. This paragraph shall apply without prejudice to Member States' national competence over forestry policy.

 

If Member States have national programmes or action plans concerning the agricultural and forestry sector and these programmes fulfil the requirements of paragraph 2 and those of the structural guidelines, Member States may use these programmes and action plans as substitute programmes for LULUCF Action Plans.

 

The Commission shall hold consultations with the Member States on their LULUCF Action Plans and within three months shall publish the findings of those consultations in a synthesis report, with a view of facilitating the exchange of knowledge and best practices among Member States.

 

The Commission may issue practicable recommendations, as appropriate, with a view to enhancing the EU's efforts to limit or reduce emissions and maintain or increase removals.

 

Member States shall take due account of the consultations with the Commission, and shall publish in electronic form and make available to the public their LULUCF Action Plans within three months of receiving the Commission’s recommendations.

4.                      Member States shall submit to the Commission, bythe date falling in the mid-point of each accounting period specified in AnnexI, and by the end of each accounting period specified in Annex I, a reportdescribing the progress in the implementation of their LULUCF Action Plans.

1.4.3.          Expected result(s) and impact

Specify the effects which theproposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.

The proposal establishes a robust and harmonised legalframework to account for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals fromactivities related to land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) in theUnion, by enabling a detailed assessment of progress in Member States (MS).More specifically, it would:

- improve the visibility of, and provide incentives for,mitigation efforts through the enhancement of removals and reduction ofemissions in agriculture and forestry and through the production of harvestedwood products in industry;

- strengthen the environmental integrity of the commitmentsby ensuring that emissions and removals are correctly reflected and securesustainable and climate-friendly bio-energy production by complementingexisting policy measures; and

- improve the economic efficiency in the pursuit of moreambitious targets by allowing all sectors to contribute.

Indicators of results and impact

Specify the indicators for monitoringimplementation of the proposal/initiative.

The following indicators correspond to the general,specific and operational objectives of the proposal:

- trends in emissions and removals;

- number of MS’ non-compliance cases, MS’ LULUCF ActionPlans (LAPs) and reports submitted on time to the Commission, MS submitting ontime their reference levels to the Commission;

- the compliance of the MS’ reports with the requirementsof the proposal;

- completeness of MS’ reports submitted to the Commissionand of degree of application by MS of common accounting rules;

- availability of data and information in the areastargeted by the proposal..

1.5.                Grounds for the proposal/initiative1.5.1.          Requirement(s) to be met in the short or longterm

The objectives of this proposal are twofold:

- to ensure robust and harmonised accounting of emissionsand removals from the LULUCF sector in the MS;

- to incentivise mitigation efforts by MS through theestablishment and implementation of LAPs;

1.5.2.          Added value of EU involvement

Taking action at Union level would produce clear benefitscompared with action at MS level alone by reason of its effectiveness. As theoverarching climate change commitments are made at the Union level, it iseffective to also develop the required accounting rules at this level.Moreover, overcoming the problems identified, such as the need to have accurateand consistent accounting rules for different LULUCF activities, requires a commonapproach across all MS which can be ensured only at the Union level.

This legal framework will ensure effective added value byemploying common and accurate accounting across all MS, establishing LAPs, andthus by enabling a more detailed assessment and appreciation of progress in MS.This will ensure the coherence of the Union’s climate policy, improve furtherthe environmental integrity of the Union’s climate change commitments andenhance the economic efficiency of the Union’s climate policy.

1.5.3.          Lessons learned from similar experiences in thepast

The proposal is based on experience achieved at international leveland is meant to address the shortcomings of the existing accounting rules underthe Kyoto Protocol (KP). Detailed assessment has been carried out in order topropose a robust and harmonised accounting framework for LULUCF.

1.5.4.          Coherence and possible synergy with otherrelevant instruments

The proposal is consistent with the Europe 2020 Strategyand the Europe 2020 flagship initiative for a resource-efficient Europe. It isalso complementary with the existing Union climate, energy and social policies.

It also complements the post- 2013 Common AgriculturalPolicy (CAP) with regard to implementing the ‘greening components’ and in thecontext of Union’s Rural Development Policy, incentives for carbonsequestration in agriculture and forestry could be significantly improved.Proper accounting of associated positive carbon fluxes would make the positivecontribution of these policy measures implemented through the CAP more visible.

Accounting for LULUCF would therefore support thesustainable use of bio-energy and would also provide a robust, clear andvisible indicator of progress in agriculture and forestry. Withoutcomprehensive mandatory accounting for LULUCF activities, the efforts investedby MS, farmers and foresters to provide climate change mitigation services willnot be reflected in the Union’s efforts to reach its GHG reduction targets.

Comments

The MS will be responsible for implementing thebulk of this proposal. The Commission will assess the information included inthe reports submitted by MS and issue recommendations, where appropriate.

2.                      MANAGEMENT MEASURES2.1.                Monitoring and reporting rules

Specify frequency and conditions.

MS will include information in their LULUCF accounts onan annual basis and will account for emissions and removals from LULUCFpursuant to this proposal at the end of each accounting period.

The reports prepared under this proposal will be assessedby the Commission for each accounting period, based on technical expertiseassistance.

A study would be needed to assess the implementation ofthis Decision in the context of the review clause.

2.2.                Management and control system2.2.1.          Risk(s) identified

As the proposal is a Decision, the implementation risks are limitedbecause the proposed obligations are based on already established internationalrules applied by the MS in the framework of their commitments under the KP.

2.2.2.          Control method(s) envisaged

The measures to address eventual risks will consist of: constructivedialogue and cooperation with the MS, maintaining contact with the relevantCommission services, especially in view of ensuring satisfaction of the correspondingdata needs, consulting experts, especially when adopting the delegated acts,accessing external technical expertise for the corresponding evaluations,conducting studies when reviewing the legal act, and organising thematicconferences, where appropriate.

2.3.                Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities

Specify existing or envisaged preventionand protection measures.

Given the amounts involved and the type of procurement,this initiative does not present particular risks of fraud. The Commission willmanage and control the work by using all relevant regular tools, such as theAnnual Management Plan of DG CLIMA.

Internal control standards No 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15and 16 are of particular relevance. In addition, the principles laid down inCouncil Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/202 (the ‘Financial Regulation’) andits implementing rules, will be fully applied.

The procurement procedures will be governed by the commonDG CLIMA financial circuit: a partially decentralised circuit which main characteristicis the hierarchical independence from the AO(s)D of the persons performingfinancial initiation and verification.

Moreover, an internal control committee (ENVAC) examinesthe procedure leading to the choice of the contractor and verifies the consistencyof the procedures adopted by the Authorising Officers with the rules andprovision of the Financial Regulation and the Implementing Rules for acombination of a random sample and a risk-based sample of public procurementcontracts.

On top of these measures, for the adoption of delegatedacts it will be ensured that the persons taking part to the expertconsultations are independent and appropriately qualified.
