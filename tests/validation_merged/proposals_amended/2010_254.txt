 | EUROPEAN COMMISSION |

Brussels, 21.9.2010

COM(2010) 490 final

2010/0254 (COD)

Proposal for a

DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Council Directive 2001/112/EC relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

Council Directive 2001/112/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption lays down rules governing the composition, use of reserved descriptions, manufacturing specifications and labelling of the products concerned, in order to ensure their free movement within the European Union.

Commission Directive 2009/106/EC of 14 August 2009[1] is the first amendment to Directive 2001/112/EC. It introduces minimum Brix values (soluble dry matter content) for 18 reconstituted fruit juices and reconstituted fruit purées and specifies the sales name to be used for fruit juice from concentrate. This amendment of the directive is based on revised international standards, in particular the Codex Alimentarius for fruit juices and nectars (Codex Stan 247-2005) and the Code of Practice of the European Fruit Juice Association (AIJN).

The present draft directive, a Directive of the Parliament and of the Council, is the second measure amending Directive 2001/112/EC and is aimed at incorporating more of the provisions of the Codex Alimentarius standard, while also taking account of the AIJN Code of Practice. This draft directive, which is technical in nature, reaffirms the distinction between fruit juice and fruit juice from concentrate, simplifies the provisions on the restitution of flavour and aroma, provides for the removal of sugar from the list of authorised ingredients and includes tomatoes in the list of fruits used for fruit juice production.

The European Union's fruit juice market represents 10% of the total consumption of non-alcoholic drinks. With regard to the segmentation of this market, the production of fruit juice from concentrate is predominant as compared to juice produced directly (respectively 87.6% and 12.4%). At the level of the world fruit juice market, the only product in which there is significant trade is fruit and fruit juice concentrate (especially orange juice), which for the most part comes from Brazil. As for juice produced directly, the countries of the European Union are essentially supplied by the Spanish market and also from Brazil.

The proposed Directive has no impact on the budget of the European Union.

This proposed directive will follow the ordinary legislative procedure provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It will take account, as of now, of the redefinition of the competences of the Commission (Articles 290/291 of the Treaty). Consequently, it will amend Articles 7 and 8 of the current directive by including all implementing measures in the category of delegated acts.

2010/0254 (COD)

Proposal for a

DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

amending Council Directive 2001/112/EC relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[2],

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[3],

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

(1) In order to protect the interests of consumers and provide them with as much information as possible, to ensure that fruit juice are clearly labelled and consumers are able to distinguish between types of products and to enhance the free movement of fruit juices and certain similar products within the European Union, Council Directive 2001/112/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption1 has laid down specific provisions regarding production, composition and labelling of the products concerned. The concepts should be clarified and clearly differentiated and categories established in order to adapt those rules to technical progress and take account of developments in relevant international standards, in particular the Codex Standard for fruit juices and nectars (Codex Stan 247-2005) which was adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission during its 28th session on 4-9 July 2005 and the Code of Practice of the European Fruit Juice Association (AIJN).The criteria laid down in this Directive should apply equally to products manufactured in the Union and to imported products.

2.  The above Codex Standard establishes in particular quality factors and labelling requirements for fruit juices and similar products. The AIJN Code of Practice also establishes quality factors for fruit juice from concentrate and is internationally used as a reference standard for self-regulation in the fruit juice industry. Directive 2001/112/EC should be brought into line, as far as possible, with those standards.

(3) Without prejudice to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs1, it is necessary to amend the specific provisions of Directive 2001/112/EC on the labelling of fruit juices and similar products to reflect the new rules on authorised ingredients, such as those relating to the addition of sugars no longer authorised in fruit juices. There should be a ban on the use of misleading or ambiguous descriptions such as ‘natural juice’, which suggest that juices have been produced directly from fruit, where this is not the case.

(3a) The words ‘with no added sugar’ have been used in relation to fruit juice for a very long time. Their disappearance from one day to the next may mislead consumers, prompting them to turn to other drinks that do feature such a statement. Provision should therefore be made, for a limited time, for a derogation to enable the industry to inform consumers properly.

4.  The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of the adaptation of the non-essential elements of Directive 2001/112/EC to technical progress and last developments in relevant international standards. The delegation of powers should be explicitly defined.

5.  Directive 2001/112/EC should be amended accordingly,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 1 Amendment of Directive 2001/112/EC

Directive 2001/112/EC is amended as follows:

(1) In Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:

3. For products manufactured from two or more fruits, except where lemon and lime juice are used under the conditions laid down in Part II.2 of Annex I, the product names shall be supplemented by a list of the fruits used, in descending order of the volume of the fruit juices or purées included. However, in the case of products manufactured from three or more fruits, the indication of the fruits used may be replaced by the words “several fruits” or a similar wording, or by the number of fruits used. In any event, all fruits used must be indicated in the ingredients list in descending order of volume, and followed by the quantity, expressed as a percentage, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No […] of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers.

 

If any fruit is mentioned in the product name, the principal name of the product shall correspond to its dominant fruit.

3a. Pictorial representations on the package shall not mislead the consumer as to the actual composition of the juice.

4. Nectars and specific products of Annex III may be sweetened by the addition of sugars, honey or sweeteners. In such cases, the addition shall be clearly indicated in the list of ingredients, as stipulated under current legislation, specifying the maximum quantity of sugar added, calculated as dry matter and expressed in grams per litre. In the case of honey, except natural honey, its full composition and/or its glucose content shall be listed .

4a. In order to help consumers differentiate between juice and nectar in terms of their sugar content, the term 'without added sugar' shall be allowed for fruit juices included in Part I, point 1 of Annex I, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods1. By [five years after the entry into force of this Directive], the use of this wording shall be reviewed .

4b. In the case of fruit juices reconstituted from concentrates, product names shall contain the words ‘from concentrate’ or ‘juice reconstituted from concentrate’, in characters at least half the size of those used for the name of the fruit juice.

4c. Checks must be in place to ensure that no fruit seeds are present in the final juice product. In cases where seeds may be present in the final juice product, they shall be clearly labelled indicating the possible presence of seeds.

5..The addition to fruit juice of extra pulp or cells as defined in point 7 of Annex II shall be indicated on the labelling.



(2) Article 4 is replaced by the following:

"Article 4

The labelling of concentrated fruit juice referred to in Annex I, Part I, point 2, not intended for delivery to the final consumer, shall bear a reference indicating the presence and quantity of added lemon juice, lime juice or acidifying agents permitted by Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives. This reference shall appear on the packaging. It shall be prohibited to use misleading or ambiguous descriptions such as ‘natural juice’, which suggest that juices have been produced directly from fruit when this is not the case.



* OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 16."

ANNEX " ANNEX I

PRODUCT NAMES, DEFINITIONS OF PRODUCTS AND CHARACTERISTICS

I DEFINITIONS

1. a) Fruit juice

The fermentable but unfermented product obtained from the edible part of fruit which is sound and ripe, fresh or preserved by chilling or freezing of one or more kinds mixed together having the characteristic colour, flavour and taste typical of the juice of the fruit from which it comes.

Flavour, pulp, and cells from the juice which are separated during processing may be restored to the same juice. This provision shall not apply to the flavour restoration of pineapples, grapes and tomatoes, considering the technological impossibility of this process.


In the case of citrus fruits, the fruit juice must come from the endocarp. Lime juice, however, may be obtained from the whole fruit.

Some juices may be processed from fruits with pips, seeds and peel, which are not usually incorporated in the juice; where necessary, however, parts or components of pips, seeds and peel, which cannot be removed by good manufacturing practices are accepted.

The mixing of fruit juice with fruit purée is authorised in the production of the fruit juice.

b) Fruit juice from concentrate

The product obtained by restoring to the concentrated fruit juice water extracted from that juice during concentration, and restoring the flavour and, if appropriate, pulp and cells lost from the juice. The water added must display appropriate characteristics, particularly from the chemical, microbiological and organoleptic viewpoints, in such a way as to guarantee the essential qualities of the juice.
The solids content of the finished product shall meet the minimum Brix level for reconstituted juice specified in Annex V.

If a juice from concentrate is manufactured from a fruit not mentioned in Annex V, the minimum Brix level of the reconstituted juice shall be the Brix level of the juice as extracted from the fruit used to make the concentrate.


Flavour, pulp and cells obtained by suitable physical means from the same species of fruit may be restored to the juice. Where flavour is restored, the addition of flavour must feature on the label of the fruit juice product.

The juice is prepared by suitable processes, which maintain the essential physical, chemical, organoleptical and nutritional characteristics of an average type of juice of the fruit from which it comes.

The mixing of fruit juice and/or concentrated fruit juice with fruit purée and/or concentrated fruit purée is authorised in the production of fruit juice from concentrate.

2. Concentrated fruit juice

The product obtained from fruit juice of one or more species by the physical removal of a specific proportion of the water content. Where the product is intended for direct consumption, that removal shall be of at least 50%.

Flavour, pulp and cells obtained by suitable physical means from the same species of fruit may be restored to the fruit juice concentrates.

3. Water extracted fruit juice

The product obtained by diffusion with water of:

-  pulpy whole fruit whose juice cannot be extracted by any physical means, or

-  dehydrated whole fruit.

Such products may be concentrated and reconstituted. The solids content of the finished product shall meet the minimum Brix level for reconstituted juice specified in Annex V.

4. Dehydrated/powdered fruit juice

The product obtained from fruit juice of one or more species by the physical removal of virtually all the water content.

5. Fruit nectar
