<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   <u>The Commission Proposal</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal for a Directive lays down an EU legislative framework for financial collateral arrangements between a collateral provider and a collateral taker. Collateral is considered very important in the context of payment and securities settlement systems to reduce legal uncertainty. With increasingly high volumes in these systems exposing market participants to a higher degree of credit exposure, they have a strong incentive to reduce their risk through netting and collateralisation. Until the emergence of this proposal, the only legislation at European level regulating the use of netting and cross-border collateral in the context of financial transactions was the 1998 Settlement Finality Directive (SFD), and this Directive only addressed security provided in connection with the operations of Member State central banks and the ECB. This proposal was therefore considered essential by the Commission and market participants alike to extend the legal certainty provided by the SFD more generally to financial markets.</p>
<p class="text-left">Currently, financial institutions who seek to reduce credit risk through the use of collateral face fifteen different legal regimes as regards perfection requirements (the procedures a collateral taker must follow to ensure the rights to the collateral are good against third parties, including a liquidator in the event of bankruptcy). In addition to having to consider the impact of very different bankruptcy laws across the EU, institutions also face uncertainties regarding the law applicable to cross-border transfers of so-called 'book entry securities' (financial instruments title to which is evidenced by entries in a register). These administrative burdens hamper a cost-effective and integrated EU market and create legal uncertainty, as there is a higher risk of invalidation of collateral in a cross-border context than in a domestic context.</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal therefore aims to provide a uniform minimum regime for the provision of securities and cash as collateral under both pledge and title transfer structures, including repurchase agreements (or 'repos' - where securities are sold against cash, with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase equivalent securities at a specific price at a future date or on demand).</p>
<p class="text-left">The principle objectives of the proposal are:</p>
<p class="text-left">-   ensuring that effective and reasonably simple regimes exist for the creation of collateral under either title transfer (including repo) or pledge structures, i.e. providing that the only perfection requirement or procedure to follow to protect a collateral agreement should be that the interest be notified to, and recorded by, the relevant intermediary maintaining the securities account;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   providing limited protection of collateral arrangement from some rules of insolvency law, in particular those that would inhibit the effective realisation of collateral or cast doubt on the validity of techniques such as close-out netting, the provision of top-up collateral and substitution of collateral;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   creating legal certainty regarding the conflict of laws treatment of book entry securities used as collateral in a cross-border context;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   limiting the administrative burdens affecting the use of collateral in the financial markets by restricting the imposition of onerous formalities on either the creation or the enforcement of collateral arrangements;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   ensuring that agreements permitting collateral taker to re-use the collateral for its own purposes under pledge structures are recognised as effective, as for repos; and</p>
<p class="text-left">-   creating a sound and efficient legal regime for limiting credit risk through the use of collateral will improve the functioning and stability of the European financial markets.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   The rapporteur's approach</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal for a Directive on collateral is as an essential element of the package of legislative proposals which needs to be adopted in order to achieve an integrated financial market in Europe. Encouraging the greater use of collateral through the creation of a coherent framework offering legal certainty, especially for cross-border collateral, will be highly beneficial in terms of reduced risk, a stronger financial system and increased competitiveness. However, while there is broad agreement on the importance of the proposal and its main elements, there are a number of issues which need to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>In my view, the most fundamental issue at stake in the proposal is its scope of application, and the corresponding delegation of powers to the Commission to update the proposed threshold through comitology. The proposal specifies in Article 2(4) that the collateral taker and the collateral provider must each be a public authority or a central bank, a financial institution under prudential supervision or a person other than a natural person whose capital base exceeds EUR 100 million or whose gross assets exceed EUR 1000 million. This would exclude many companies from the scope of the Directive, and in particular would exclude all small and medium enterprises from the benefit of the protection which the Directive offers to collateral. At a time when we are seeking to encourage the access of SMEs to capital, this does not seem desirable.</p>
<p>This issue also relates to the Lamfalussy approach to securities regulation, as the proposal delegates to the Commission and the Securities Committee the power to reconsider the capital threshold, without defining the criteria that would trigger the use of this power or that the Commission would use to arrive at a new threshold. It would be wrong to delegate powers to the Commission and the Securities Committee over such a sensitive issue which touches the heart of the proposal. The scope of any Directive represents in my view an essential element which must be determined in the basic legislative instrument, and cannot be delegated to the Commission through comitology.</p>
<p class="text-left">That is why I have proposed to broaden the scope of the proposal by abolishing the threshold and requiring one of the two parties to be either a public authority, a central bank, a financial institution or a legal person. I have also proposed that legal persons should only be able to enter into a collateral arrangement with a public authority, a central bank or a financial institution. This has the advantage of considerably broadening the scope of the proposal, as well as doing away with a turnover or capital threshold which would become outdated and might need to be revised through comitology. A broader scope is also consistent with Parliament's position on the Basel capital review that the benefits of risk mitigation measures, which include collateral, should be extended to as wide as possible a range of institutions.</p>
<p class="text-left">A second key issue is whether a collateral arrangement needs to be concluded in writing and signed, as the Commission proposes. A number of Member States abolished such a requirement some time ago and therefore would regard its imposition in the Directive as a negative step. On the other hand, some countries currently require collateral arrangements to be concluded in writing and signed. I have therefore envisaged a compromise solution on this issue. This states that it would be sufficient for the collateral to be 'provided' ('delivered, transferred, held, registered or otherwise designated so as to be in the possession or under the control of the collateral taker') so long as that 'provision can be evidenced in writing'. This would mean that so long as a written trace (defined as including recording in electronic form) could be found of the provision of collateral, it would fall within the scope of the Directive.</p>
<p class="text-left">Another issue which has been raised is the question of whether to include so-called 'credit risk top-up collateral' in the scope of the proposal. Some in industry have argued that so long as the need for additional collateral to be provided is linked to an objective trigger, such as a downgrading in a firm's credit rating, then this should be allowed. I share the view of the Commission and many Member States, which is that allowing credit risk top-up collateral would conflict with insolvency law policy, which in general discourages provisions under which a creditor's position is improved as a result of, or at the time of, an insolvency related event or at least a context of degraded or deteriorating credit worthiness.</p>
<p class="text-left">With regard to the right of use for pledge collateral, some concern has been expressed that the text is unclear. For the avoidance of doubt, it should be made clear that the right of use of pledge collateral should only be possible where it is agreed in advance by the parties to the collateral arrangement.</p>
<p class="text-left">The whole question of the balance between the legal framework for collateral and the provisions of insolvency law is a delicate one. While finance ministries want to promote the use of collateral to ensure a more liquid capital market, national ministries of justice are concerned that the rules in article 9 which disapply certain insolvency provisions will benefit collateral takers to the exclusion of other creditors in the event of a company becoming insolvent. In my view the Commission has taken a balanced approach to this issue which deserves support.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is also important to ensure that the current discussions at the Hague conference on international private law are reflected in the approach we take to article 10. As paragraph one of article 10 outlines the key principle of the place of the relevant intermediary, it is in my view best not to tie the hands of Member States and the Commission in the discussions at the Hague by being too prescriptive, which is why I have proposed the deletion of paragraph 2.</p></div><div class="separator separator-dotted separator-2x my-3"></div><h2 id="_section5">OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AFFAIRS AND THE INTERNAL MARKET</h2><div><p><strong>16 October 2001</strong></p>

<p><strong class="text-left">Draftsman: Klaus-Heiner Lehne</strong></p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market appointed Klaus-Heiner Lehne draftsman at its meeting of 24 April 2001.</p>
<p class="text-left">It considered the draft opinion at its meeting(s) of 10 September, 17 September and 16 October 2001.</p>
<p class="text-left">At the last meeting it adopted the following amendments unanimously.</p>
<p class="text-left">The following were present for the vote: Willi Rothley acting chairman; Rainer Wieland, vice-chairman; Ward Beysen, vice-chairman; Paolo Bartolozzi, Maria Berger, Philip Charles Bradbourn (for The Lord Inglewood), Bert Doorn, Janelly Fourtou, Marie-Françoise Garaud, Gerhard Hager, Malcolm Harbour, Stephen Hughes (for Carlos Candal pursuant to Rule 153(2)), Ioannis Koukiadis, Helmut Kuhne (for Enrico Boselli pursuant to Rule 153(2)), Neil MacCormick, Toine Manders, Luís Marinho, Hans-Peter Mayer, Arlene McCarthy, Manuel Medina Ortega, Bill Miller, Feleknas Uca, Michiel van Hulten, Joachim Wuermeling, Stefano Zappalà, Jürgen Zimmerling (for Kurt Lechner) and Alejandro Cercas.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission's proposal puts forward a simple and effective Community legal framework to limit credit risk in financial transactions through the provision of securities and cash as collateral and to restrict onerous and superfluous formalities on the creation or the enforcement of collateral arrangements.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your draftsman views this proposal as a crucial element of a truly integrated financial market and welcomes its contribution to legal clarity in collateral arrangements by removing the insecurity created by the existing mosaic of national regulations that increases costs and presents a serious barrier to financial market development within the EU.</p>
<p class="text-left">He also commends its approach of permitting collateral-takers to re-use collateral for their own purposes under pledge structures, thus favouring liquidity, as well as the extension of the principles already applied under the Directive on settlement finality.</p>
<p class="text-left">Be it as it may, your rapporteur would make three main points:</p>
<p class="text-left">(1)   This proposal does not create opportunities for small and medium sized financial entities to participate in the wholesale financial market, currently dominated by large companies. Companies with a capital base exceeding € 100 million or whose gross assets exceed € 1000 million would benefit from a privileged status (e.g. in relation to insolvency laws) in comparison to companies below those thresholds.</p>
<p class="text-left">(2)   The proposal provides for protection of collateral arrangements against certain insolvency rules. Given the exceptional nature of these rules, justified only when absolutely essential to the functioning of the financial market, they should be limited to public authorities and central banks, and financial institutions under prudential supervision.</p>
<p class="text-left">(3)   It is difficult to perceive why the Commission, while exercising its powers of implementation, should be assisted by a committee. The task of implementation should be entrusted fully to the Commission.</p>
<p class="text-left">The amendments tabled below seek to address the three aims described above.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>AMENDMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market calls on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following amendments in its report:</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless"><tr><td class="w-50 text-center">Text proposed by the Commission<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part8_ref1" href="#_part8_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 8.1">[1]</a></td><td class="w-50 text-center">Amendments by Parliament</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="text-center"><strong>Amendment 1</strong><br /><strong>Recital 14</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="w-50">
