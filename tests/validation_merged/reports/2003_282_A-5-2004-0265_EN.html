<p class="text-left"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The biggest problem with batteries and accumulators is that they contain heavy metals: mercury, lead and cadmium. Directive 98/101/EC (amending Directive 91/157/EEC) therefore prohibited batteries containing mercury (i.e. more than 5 ppm mercury), with the exception of button cells for hearing aids and watches. Such button cells, like batteries containing more than 0.025% cadmium or 0.4% lead, must be collected separately pursuant to Directive 91/157/EEC. In practice, the collection only of batteries containing mercury, lead or cadmium did not work, because consumers did not distinguish between batteries along these lines. This is one of the reasons why the Commission decided to opt for the collection of all batteries, the other reason being that valuable material from all batteries can be recycled.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">This amendment of the directive on batteries has been awaited for years. In its resolution of 25 January 1998, the Council asked the Commission to submit as soon as possible a proposal for a Community action programme to combat pollution of the environment with cadmium. In the second half of 2000, amendment of the 1991 directive on batteries was on the official agenda of the French Presidency, but this did not lead to any proposal. Since then, the Commission has on several occasions promised to submit a proposal. The need to do so was also urged in connection with the adoption of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (Directive 2002/96/EC), Recital 11 of which states, 'Directive 91/157/EEC needs to be revised as soon as possible, particularly in the light of this Directive.' At the Environment Committee's meetings of 11 September 2001 and 19 February 2003, Mr Blokland and Mr Lund tabled written questions urging the Commission to revise the directive on batteries without delay. Nearly six years after the Council's resolution on cadmium, a proposal has finally been received from the Commission. In the meantime, related EU legislation has banned the use of the heavy metals mercury, lead and cadmium in components and materials in vehicles placed on the market after 1 July 2003 and in new electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market after 1 July 2006.</p>
<p class="text-left">The directive on end-of-life vehicles (2000/53/EC) bans the use of cadmium in vehicles, while permitting the use of NiCd batteries in electric vehicles until 31 January 2005. This period may be extended.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (2002/95/EC) restricts the use of heavy metals. In principle, cadmium is banned, with a limited exception for surface treatment. Other restrictions on the use of heavy metals in batteries were left to this directive.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Substance of the Commission proposal</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Important new elements in the Commission proposal in comparison with Directive 91/157/EEC are:</p>
<p class="text-left">1.   the scope of the directive is extended to all batteries, all of which must now be collected;</p>
<p class="text-left">2.   binding collection rates (at least 160 g per inhabitant per annum for portable batteries with effect from 5½ years after the publication of the new directive);</p>
<p class="text-left">3.   binding recycling rates and recycling efficiencies;</p>
<p class="text-left">4.   financing mechanism under which producer responsibility plays a large role.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are no other significant changes in comparison with 1991.</p>
<p class="text-left">As regards heavy metals, the quantitative proposals are as follows:</p><ul class="d-table mb-1 pl-2"><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">Portable batteries must not contain more than 5 ppm mercury (except in the case of button cells).</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">100% of lead batteries for motor vehicles and industrial use must be collected (due to the ban on final disposal) and recycled with a minimum efficiency of 65%.</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">100% of nickel-cadmium batteries for industrial use must be collected (due to the ban on final disposal) and recycled with a minimum efficiency of 75%.</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">Portable nickel-cadmium batteries are subject to a collection rate of 160 g, and 80% of the available quantity must be collected and recycled with a minimum efficiency of 75%.</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell">Other portable batteries (zinc-carbon, zinc-magnesium, nickel-metal hydride, lithium ion, etc.) are subject to the collection rate of 160 g and are to be recycled with a minimum efficiency of 55%.</span></li></ul>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Comments on the Commission proposal</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The four new elements in the Commission proposal, as described in the previous section, are to be welcomed. However, there are some comments to be made, particularly regarding points 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="text-left">Re 1 (collection of all types of batteries)</p>
<p class="text-left">In the Member States where all batteries are collected, collection works much better than in those where only batteries containing mercury, lead or cadmium are collected. It is also very sensible that the Commission has not opted for a collection rate based on annual sales. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain (even retrospectively) whether such a collection rate was being attained. It is difficult to correlate collection statistics with sales figures. Batteries may remain in use for years, after which it is not uncommon for them to lie about the home for years longer. The problem with portable batteries is that consumers do not feel a strong urge to return them. They are small and therefore do not get in the way but tend to be left lying in drawers, boxes and so on. The situation with paper and glass is very different. Within a few weeks, boxes of paper and crates of glass containers begin to create an obstacle, and they are therefore removed quickly. This explains why consumers may retain batteries for so long. The decision to opt for a quantity in grams which can readily be checked is therefore much better. The Commission's extended impact assessment states that a quantity of 160-200 g is the most cost-efficient (SEC(2003) 134, p. 78). Thus it is possible to opt for a figure of 200 g per inhabitant per annum. Moreover, Member States can link the necessary arrangements to collection systems which exist under the WEEE Directive. There are therefore strong arguments in favour of opting for a slightly more ambitious figure of 200 g per inhabitant per annum. On average, this target represents a collection rate of approximately 50% of annual sales.</p>
<p class="text-left">Re 2 (compulsory collection rates)</p>
<p class="text-left">In addition to the collection quantity (the 160 g proposed by the Commission) for portable batteries, it follows from the proposed ban on the disposal of industrial and car batteries that 100% of these batteries must be collected. The current practice is to collect and recycle all of these large batteries via the existing collection systems. Thus the ban on final disposal is no problem at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the case of portable batteries the situation is quite different, and it is for this reason that the Commission has decided on a quantity in grams to be collected. For portable nickel-cadmium batteries, however, an additional collection obligation is also proposed. This is inconsistent with the approach to other batteries. The proposed collection rate for nickel-cadmium batteries is high: 80% of the quantity available for collection. It is not clear why the Commission anticipates that this high collection rate can be attained. The reason for opting for a high rate is the so-called closed-loop system for cadmium. Even with a collection rate of 80%, there will not be a closed loop, because 20% of the cadmium will still enter the ordinary waste stream and ultimately find its way into incinerators or landfills. As cadmium is a volatile metal, if waste containing it is incinerated it will inevitably be emitted into the air.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Monitoring of nickel-cadmium batteries in the waste stream</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In order to ascertain whether 80% of the available quantity of portable nickel-cadmium batteries has been collected, a complicated method is proposed. Briefly, it means that four times as many nickel-cadmium batteries must be collected as are disposed of with domestic refuse. Samples are to be taken of domestic refuse in order to ascertain what quantity of nickel-cadmium batteries the total quantity of domestic refuse contains. The following calculation shows what quantities are involved. In 2002, 158 000 tons of batteries were marketed in the EU, including 10 994 tons of nickel-cadmium batteries. Assuming that urban refuse totalled 200 million tons (in 2000), this means that 0.0055% of all urban refuse consists of nickel-cadmium batteries. Thus in order to obtain a representative sample it would be necessary to take an enormous quantity of domestic refuse, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tons. The very high costs of this sampling are not taken into account in the Extended Impact Assessment (SEC(2003)134). Moreover, it is not clear who is to pay for it. This absurd method of checking whether the collection target is being attained will confer absolutely no environmental benefits. If account is taken of the waste strategy (in which the order of priority is: prevention, recycling, disposal), it goes without saying that efforts must be made to eliminate heavy metals from the waste stream.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Prevention of heavy metals</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">On pages 9 to 12 of the Explanatory Memorandum on the Commission's proposal, the damaging effects of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and lead on the environment and health are clearly described. Directive 98/101/EC (amending Directive 91/157/EEC) bans batteries containing mercury (= more than 5 ppm mercury). EU law now bans motor components and materials in vehicles placed on the market after 1 July 2003 from containing the heavy metals mercury, lead and cadmium, and the same applies to new electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market after 1 July 2006. In accordance with existing law, the use of mercury, cadmium and lead should also be limited as strictly as possible under this directive. In a number of cases, exceptions are justified, such as mercury in hearing aids, lead in car batteries and cadmium for industrial uses, as it is disputed whether reliable substitutes exist for these applications.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission has not opted to ban cadmium and lead in portable batteries because a closed loop for cadmium in portable batteries would supposedly afford the same environmental protection (p. 31). As has already been observed in this Explanatory Statement, a closed loop is impossible. Cadmium and lead are being removed from existing products (scrap vehicles, WEEE, PVC, plastics, etc.). As this directive incorporates measures restricting various damaging substances, it would also have been logical to take similar measures with regard to the hazardous substances contained in batteries.</p>
<p class="text-left">Moreover, there is a clear trend towards nickel-metal hydride and lithium ion batteries as replacements for NiCd batteries in electronic equipment. As satisfactory alternatives exist for these applications and are already in use on a large scale (lithium-metal hydride in mobile phones, for example), a ban on portable NiCd batteries is justified. Such a ban will prevent the damaging and polluting effects of cadmium.</p>
<p class="text-left">In brief, if one wishes to make progress from the point of view of the environment by means of this directive, one should at least, where possible, limit the use of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and lead in batteries.</p></div><div class="separator separator-dotted separator-2x my-3"></div><h2 id="_section4">OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AFFAIRS AND THE INTERNAL MARKET ON THE LEGAL BASIS</h2><div>
<p><strong class="text-left">Subject: <em>Legal basis of the proposal for a Directive on batteries and accumulators and spent batteries and accumulators - COM(2003)723 - 2003/0282(COD) - C5-0563/2003</em></strong></p>
<p><strong class="text-left">Dear Mrs Jackson,</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">By letter of 22 January 2004 you requested the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, under Rule 63(2), to consider the issue of the appropriate legal basis for the above proposal. You did so because, while the Commission had based its proposal on Article 95(1) and 175(1) of the EC Treaty, some Members of your Committee took the view that the correct legal basis should be solely Article 175(1) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market considered the above question at its meeting of 8 March 2004.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is essentially asked to verify the choice of the appropriate legal basis for the measure which the Commission proposes and, in particular, on whether it should be founded on Article 95 or Article 175 of the EC Treaty. Both Article 95 EC and Article 175 EC lay down the co-decision procedure.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is clear from settled case law of the ECJ that the choice of the legal basis does not depend on the discretion of the Community legislature but must be based on objective elements which are amenable to judicial control. Among these elements are, in particular, the aim and the content of the legal act.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref1" href="#_part7_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.1">[1]</a> In practice, the Court bases its findings essentially on the recitals stated in the preamble.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is also necessary to determine whether the measures in question relate principally to a particular field of action, having only incidental effects on other policies, or whether both aspects are equally essential. If the first hypothesis is correct, recourse to a single legal basis is sufficient<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref2" href="#_part7_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.2">[2]</a>; if the second is correct, it is insufficient<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref3" href="#_part7_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.3">[3]</a> and the institution is required to adopt the measure on the basis of both of the provisions from which its competence derives.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref4" href="#_part7_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.4">[4]</a> However, no such dual basis is possible where the procedures laid down for each legal basis are incompatible with each other.<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref5" href="#_part7_def5" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.5">[5]</a></p>
<p class="text-left">In the present case, application of those criteria amounts to asking whether the draft Directive, in the light of its context, its aim and its content, constitutes an act principally concerning environmental protection which is liable to have incidental effects on the internal market, whether, conversely, it is principally an act concerning internal market which incidentally takes account of certain environmental requirements, or whether it is inextricably concerned both with environmental protection and with internal market.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is true that numerous provisions of the draft Directive relate specifically to the environment. However, the fact remains that, as shown by the above considerations, the draft Directive is, in the light of its aim and its content, also an instrument intended to harmonise the legislation of the Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="text-left">It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that adoption of the Directive must be founded on a dual legal basis. Consequently, Article 95(1) and Article 175(1) of the EC Treaty, is the appropriate legal basis.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market thus unanimously decided<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref6" href="#_part7_def6" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.6">[6]</a> that Article 95(1) and Article 175(1) of the EC Treaty is the appropriate legal basis.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Giuseppe Gargani</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The purpose of the Commission proposal is to make the use of batteries and accumulators environment friendlier and simplify the legislation in this area.</p>
<p class="text-left">At present about 158 000 tonnes of portable batteries and accumulators are sold in the EU every year, along with some 58 million, or approximately 870 000 tonnes of, automotive batteries. Nationwide separate collection is as yet compulsory only for automotive batteries. According to a study carried out for the Commission<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part8_ref1" href="#_part8_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 8.1">[1]</a> only five Member States to date have produced figures on collection rates, which range from 76% in Sweden to 91% in France. The Austrian result is an outlier to the extent that collection has exceeded sales. The collection rates for portable batteries and accumulators are better documented and range between 0.5% in the United Kingdom – where collection has not yet been organised – and 60% in Belgium. The figures for Denmark are for nickel-cadmium batteries only, the return rate being 98%. No figures are available for the accession countries.</p>
<p class="text-left">Batteries can contain many dangerous substances and are therefore divided into two categories:</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   dangerous batteries</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">lead: above all rechargeable lead-acid batteries used in cars; about 75% of world lead production is used for automotive batteries;</p>
<p class="text-left">nickel-cadmium batteries account for some 75% of total EU cadmium consumption;</p>
<p class="text-left">batteries containing mercury (including button cells);</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   non-dangerous batteries</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>examples include nickel-metal hydride accumulators and lithium batteries.</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">One problem is what happens to dangerous batteries on landfills. They rust and leak, and in the acidic environment within the body of waste, heavy metals are washed away into leachate and possibly – depending on how well the landfill base is sealed – into groundwater. To prevent this happening, separate battery collection has been introduced in many Member States. Batteries are a rich source of secondary raw materials: not just lead and cadmium, but also nickel, cobalt, and silver can be recovered from them. Further research is needed to help develop better recycling processes.</p>
<p class="text-left">The most elegant solution to the problem lies in heavy metal-free fuel cells, which are currently being developed for various applications and could already replace heavy metal accumulators in the near future. Among the possible applications are portable personal computers and mobile telephones. The legislative authority should act as soon as the extent of progress allows. Some of the amendments tabled in this opinion are designed to provide the necessary encouragement.</p>
