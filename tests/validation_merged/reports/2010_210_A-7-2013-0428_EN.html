<p style="margin-left:42.55pt; margin-right:0pt; text-indent:-42.55pt; ">(2)         The Hague Programme, adopted by the European Council on 4 and 5 November 2004, recognised that legal migration will play an important role in advancing economic development, and asked the Commission to present a policy plan on legal migration, including admission procedures, capable of responding promptly to fluctuating demands for migrant labour in the labour market. </p>

<p style="margin-left:42.55pt; margin-right:0pt; text-indent:-42.55pt; ">(3)         The European Council of 14 and 15 December 2006 agreed on a series of steps for 2007, which include the development of well-managed legal immigration policies that fully respect national competences, in order to assist Member States in meeting existing and future labour needs. It also called for means to be explored to facilitate temporary migration.</p>

The Pact forms the basis of a common immigration policy guided by a spirit of solidarity between Member States and cooperation with third countries and founded on proper management of migratory flows, in the interests not only of the host countries but also of the countries of origin and of the migrants themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">1. Introduction</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The 2005 Commission Communication on "A Policy Plan on Legal Migration" provided for a proposal for a Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of seasonal workers, considering that "seasonal workers are regularly needed in certain sectors, where many immigrants work illegally under precarious conditions". The Commission published its proposal in July 2010 in a package together with the proposal on intra-corporate transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The Rapporteur strongly believes that this Directive is needed to prevent the exploitation of seasonal workers, especially in the light of recent events (notably in Rosarno, Italy, but not confined to any particular Member State).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Furthermore, the need for seasonal workers from outside the EU is a common phenomenon in most Member States, and a framework at EU level for the management of this migration could provide real added value. In this respect it is also noted that providing legal routes for migration can play an important role in reducing irregular migration and the exploitation that often accompanies it. It is also vital that this Directive pays close attention to the need for equal treatment in the EU labour market, to ensure that pay and working conditions are not undermined. The Rapporteur therefore welcomes this proposal in general, while noting that some areas need to be significantly strengthened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">2. General overview of proposal</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">This proposal establishes a fast-track procedure for the admission of third-country nationals employed as seasonal workers, based on a common definition and common criteria for seasonal workers. The proposal lays down the conditions under which seasonal workers would be granted a residence and work permit allowing stays of up to six months in a calendar year, and defines the rights of seasonal workers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">A number of provisions are intended to ensure stronger protection of seasonal workers, which the Rapporteur welcomes. These include the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">•          Admission is dependent on the existence of a work contract or a binding job offer that specifies the salary to be paid and other working conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">•          Employers are required to provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have appropriate accommodation during their stay. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">•          Designated third parties, such as trade unions and NGOs, shall be able to complain on behalf of seasonal workers in order to ensure effective enforcement of the rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The proposal also provides for equal treatment with national workers with respect to certain rights (Article 16). The Rapporteur, while mindful that the majority of this Article falls under the exclusive competence of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, considers that these provisions are crucial and should be further reinforced to ensure equal treatment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">3. Key amendments</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">While the Rapporteur considers that the Commission proposal contains some important provisions, he feels it could be further strengthened with a number of changes and additions as contained in the draft report. These include:</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Scope</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The scope of the Commission proposal includes only third-country nationals residing outside the EU. However, in order to ensure a comprehensive approach to seasonal work, this Directive should also apply to third-country nationals already residing in the EU who are not entitled to work under existing legislation. Furthermore it should not ignore the current situation in the seasonal work sector where many third-country nationals with an irregular status are employed in exploitative conditions. Therefore, third-country nationals in an irregular position should, for a transitional period, be able to apply for employment as a seasonal worker under this Directive. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">In terms of the sectoral scope of the Directive, some activities in the agriculture, horticulture and tourism sectors are naturally seasonal, being tied to peaks in workforce requirements, depending on the passing of seasons. These sectors should therefore be clearly stated as falling under the scope of this Directive. However, given the wide variety of situations in the Member States, some additional activities, beyond these sectors, may be brought within the scope of this Directive, but this should only happen with the agreement of the social partners.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Access to information</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Providing information to seasonal workers is an important tool in helping to reduce their vulnerability to exploitation. Therefore, information to prospective seasonal workers and employers should be made available and should allow them to make an informed choice about applying to become a seasonal worker or hiring seasonal workers. Furthermore, when seasonal workers receive their permit, they should be given information in writing about their rights under this Directive. Finally, contact points should be established in order to inform and advise seasonal workers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Seasonal worker permit</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The Commission proposal provides for a visa to be issued in place of a seasonal worker permit for stays less than three months. However, it is not clear why this needs to be the case and more importantly whether the rights associated with the seasonal worker permit apply to those working on the basis of a visa. Therefore, in order to prevent two categories of seasonal workers being created with different rights depending on their length of stay, all seasonal workers should be given a seasonal worker permit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Duration of stay</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The Rapporteur supports the provision in the Commission proposal providing for a maximum duration of stay of six months. It is questionable whether longer periods of stay can be accurately described as seasonal, and may lead to abuse of the system to the detriment of seasonal workers. Furthermore, the maximum period should take place within 12 months rather than a calendar year in order to allow for the winter season which does not fall within a calendar year. Additionally, provision should be made for seasonal workers who may be entitled to stay in the Member State under a different permit or visa, and are therefore not required to return to their country of origin.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Sanctions against employers</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The Rapporteur considers that a separate provision on sanctions against employers is required. Furthermore, given the vulnerable position of seasonal workers they should receive compensation if their permit is withdrawn as a result of their employer not fulfilling its legal obligations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The Commission proposal also provides for the grounds for refusal of an application, or the withdrawal or non-renewal of a seasonal worker permit to include cases where the employer has been sanctioned for illegal employment. In the interests of protecting seasonal workers, this should be extended to include sanctions for violations of the provisions of this Directive, and violations of working conditions or labour rights. However, given the vulnerable position of seasonal workers, a permit should only be withdrawn under these circumstances if it serves their interests. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Accommodation</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The Rapporteur considers the provision requiring employers to provide evidence that seasonal workers will benefit from adequate accommodation to be a positive element on the Commission proposal. However, it should be strengthened by referring to the requirements of national legislation and practice as well as to some minimum standards as recommended by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, the rent should not be excessive in relation to the quality of the accommodation in addition to their pay and should not be raised during a seasonal workers' stay.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Costs</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Some costs that are directly linked to the seasonal employment should be paid by the employers, including the costs of travel, visa costs and health insurance for periods outside the work contract. The payment by the employer of the costs of travel will facilitate the return of the seasonal workers to their place of origin upon the expiration of their permit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Monitoring and Inspections</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The proposal does not contain any provisions on monitoring or inspections, which the Rapporteur considers as essential to ensure that the rights of seasonal workers and the provisions of this Directive will be fully respected. The draft report therefore contains amendments to ensure that Member States put in place such mechanisms for monitoring and inspections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline; ">Facilitation of complaints</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Given the vulnerability of seasonal workers to exploitation it is essential that there are effective mechanisms in place for them to complain themselves, or via third parties. The proposal provides that third parties may lodge complaints on behalf of seasonal workers. However, this needs to be strengthened to ensure that Member States put in place effective mechanisms through which seasonal workers or third parties can complain. Furthermore, protection against victimisation is vital to make this mechanism a realistic option for seasonal workers who need to complain and would consequently be placed in a vulnerable position vis-a-vis their employer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Dear Mr Chair,</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">By letter of 4 July 2011 the Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affair, which is an associated committee within the meaning of Rule 50, with the main committee being the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, asked the Committee on Legal Affairs, pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure, to take up a question relating to the legal basis of the above-mentioned proposal for a directive. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">The committee has duly considered this request as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">The legal basis proposed by the Commission for the proposed directive is Article 79(2)(a) and (b) TFEU, which falls under Title V on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice of Part Three of the TFUE, entitled Union Policies and Internal Actions. It must be borne in mind that this provision is subject to Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland and Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark. Under those protocols, Denmark never takes part in the adoption of measures and the United Kingdom and Ireland have a choice whether or not to participate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">The Employment Committee considers that the proposed legal basis is not appropriate for the directive and proposes adding Article 153(1)(a), (b) and (g) TFEU, which falls under Title X on Social Policy of Part Three of the TFEU, entitled Union Policies and Internal Actions.  The reason for the additional legal basis is stated as being that the proposal for a directive does not regulate only issues of migration, but also questions of employment rights of the categories of workers concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">I. BACKGROUND</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">The proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of seasonal employment (COM (2010) 379)  was presented by the Commission on 13 July 2010 as a follow up to the Commission Communication "A Policy Plan on Legal Migration" (COM (2005) 669) and as a response to The Hague Programme of November 2004 (COM (2005) 184), which called upon the Commission to present a policy plan on legal migration including admission procedures, capable of responding promptly to fluctuating demands for migrant labour in the labour market.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">The Commission Communication "A Policy Plan on Legal Migration" defines a road-map for the remaining period of The Hague Programme (2006-2009) and lists the actions and legislative initiatives that the Commission intends to take in order to pursue the coherent development of EU legal migration policy. Regarding the category of seasonal workers, the above-mentioned Commission Communication sets out a scheme which will "propose a residence/work permit allowing the third-country national to work for a certain number of months per year for 4-5 years. Entry and exit stamps should prevent abuses. The aim is to provide the necessary manpower in the Member States while at the same time granting a secure legal status and a regular work prospective to the immigrants concerned, thereby protecting a particularly weak category of workers and also contributing to the development of the countries of origin."<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref1" href="#_part3_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">II. LEGAL BASIS PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">In the explanatory memorandum to the proposal, the Commission states that the appropriate legal basis is Article 79 (2) (a) and (b) TFEU, which reads as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-style:italic; ">"Article 79</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-style:italic; ">1.

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-style:italic; ">2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall adopt measures in the following areas: </span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">These provisions have to be read in conjunction with Article 153(2), which reads as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-style:italic; ">(a) may adopt measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States through initiatives aimed at improving knowledge, developing exchanges of information and best practices, promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States; </span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">IV. THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE'S APPROACH</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">It is settled case-law of the European Court of Justice that the choice of the legal basis for an act "must be based on objective factors which are amenable to judicial review and include in particular the aim and the content of the measure."<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref4" href="#_part3_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.4">[4]</a> </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">If examination of the act "reveals that it pursues a twofold purpose or that it has a twofold component and if one of those is identifiable as the main or predominant purpose or component, whereas the other is merely incidental, the act must be based on a single legal basis, namely that required by the main or predominant purpose or component.".<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref5" href="#_part3_def5" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.5">[5]</a></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">Exceptionally, "if it is established that the measure simultaneously pursues several objectives which are inseparably linked without one being secondary and indirect to the other, the measure must be founded on the corresponding legal bases."<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref6" href="#_part3_def6" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.6">[6]</a></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">However, "no dual legal basis is possible where the procedures laid down for each legal basis are incompatible with each other."<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref7" href="#_part3_def7" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.7">[7]</a></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">V. AIM AND CONTENT OF THE PROPOSAL</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">Recital 6 in the preamble to the proposed directive recalls that it "should contribute to the effective management of migration flows for the specific category of seasonal temporary migration by setting out fair and transparent rules for admission and stay, while at the same time providing for incentives and safeguards to prevent temporary stay from becoming permanent."</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">In order to pursue this objective, the proposal establishes a fast-track procedure for the admission of third-country seasonal workers based on common definitions and common criteria. Articles 1 to 13 of the proposed directive lay down the rules governing the procedure for admission.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">Recital 20 recalls that "considering the specially vulnerable situation of third-country national seasonal workers and the temporary nature of their assignment, there is a need to define clearly the working conditions applicable to such workers in order to ensure legal certainty by referring such conditions to generally binding instruments providing effective protection of the rights of third-country seasonal workers, such as law or universally applicable collective agreements." </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">In order to pursue this objective, the proposed directive lays down in Articles 15 to 16 the mentioned rights and refers to the binding instruments applicable to that category of workers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">VI. DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL BASIS</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">Having regard to the fact that the aim and content of the proposal is (1) to prescribe the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of employment as seasonal workers and (2) to define the rights of that category of workers, Article 79(2)(a) and (b) TFEU constitutes the appropriate legal basis .</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">VII. ANALYSIS OF LEGAL BASIS PROPOSED TO BE ADDED</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">Article 153(1)(a) and (b) TFEU refer to the working environment and the non-pay aspects of an employee's terms and conditions of employment. They cover such matters as the organisation of work and work activities, training, skills and employability, health, safety and well-being. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">In the light of the foregoing analysis such matters do not constitute key aspects of the proposal such as to justify recourse to those provisions as an additional legal basis in accordance with the strictures of the Court of Justice. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">As far as Article 153(1)(g) TFEU is concerned, it is concerned with conditions of employment for third country nationals legally residing in Union territory.  However, the third subparagraph of Article 153(2) prescribes a special legislative procedure for Article 153(1)(g) ("<span style="font-style:italic; ">the Council shall act unanimously, in accordance with a special legislative procedure, after consulting the European Parliament and the said Committees"</span>).  <span style="font-style:italic; "> </span>This legal basis is therefore incompatible with Article 79(2)(a) and (b) TFEU, which prescribes the ordinary legislative procedure (see Case C-338/01 <span style="font-style:italic; ">Commission</span> v <span style="font-style:italic; ">Council</span> cited above).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">This, however, is not the only incompatibility.  It is considered that Article 153 TFEU, under which legislation is adopted for the whole of the Union, cannot be used in conjunction with Article 79 TFEU, since Denmark does not participate at all in the adoption of legislation under that article and the United Kingdom and Ireland have the right not to so participate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">VII. CONCLUSION</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">In the light of the foregoing analysis, Article 79(2)(a) and (b) TFEU is the sole appropriate legal basis for the proposed directive. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:justify; ">At its meeting of 22 November 2011 the Committee on Legal Affairs accordingly decided, by by 18 votes in favour, with 1 abstention<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref8" href="#_part3_def8" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.8">[8]</a>, to recommend that Article 79(2) (a) and (b) TFEU should be retained as the sole appropriate legal basis for the proposed directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:center; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">SHORT JUSTIFICATION</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The proposal for a directive concerns the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of seasonal employment and constitutes a major step in seeking to build a comprehensive EU common migration policy. It forms part of the package on legal migration announced by the Commission at the end of 2005, which provides for the adoption of five separate legislative measures aimed at fleshing out and developing EU migration policy in a coherent manner. The first measure, i.e. the Blue Card Directive (Directive 2009/50/EC), was adopted on 25 May 2009. The proposal for a Single Permit Directive was adopted at first reading by Parliament on 24 March 2011 and is now the subject of discussions between the Council and Parliament. This proposal for a directive was submitted at the same time as the proposal for an ICT directive (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2010&amp;nu_doc=0378">COM(2010)0378</a>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">It will need to take account of and be consistent with existing migration legislation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The directive’s main aims are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">– to establish a common framework, based on clear, appropriate and transparent rules, for nationals of third countries entering and staying in Europe for the purposes of seasonal work (hereinafter ‘seasonal workers’); </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">– to provide for incentives and measures to ensure that seasonal workers do not remain illegally in the EU at the end of their authorised period of residence; </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">– to protect seasonal workers and avoid them having to face situations of exploitation and working and living conditions that are not decent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">As your rapporteur, I wish to stress that this report only deals with those parts of the proposal which fall within the remit of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, whether exclusive (Recitals 20, 21 and 22 and Articles 3(f) and 16, and, as regards the exclusions relating to the employment market and social security, Recital 9 and Article 2(2)) or shared (Recitals 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 and 23 and Articles 3(b), 3(c), 4(2), 5(1)(a), 5(1)(d), 6(2), 14 and 17). </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The main issue within our committee’s remit in relation to this directive is the exploitation and degrading living and working conditions which seasonal workers are forced to endure. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">It should be pointed out, in this context, that those seasonal workers most easily affected by exploitation are those illegally resident in the EU. A vital total in combating illegal immigration is the Directive on sanctions against employers (Directive 2009/52/EC). However, the directive under discussion will make a significant contribution in this area by establishing a clear, common and transparent framework for the entry and residence of migrants in a Member State for the purposes of seasonal employment and thereby promoting the use of legal migration channels. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">In seeking to protect seasonal workers, we should closely follow the position set out in Parliament's resolution of 26 September 2007 on the Policy Plan on Legal Migration, of which this proposal for a directive forms a part: ‘recalls the need to avoid double standards of rights amongst different categories of workers and to safeguard particularly the rights of seasonal workers and paid trainees, who are more vulnerable to abuse’. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Achieving this objective is important no only for reasons of equity, social justice and respect for the dignity of the seasonal workers concerned, but also in recognition of the contribution they make through their work and the taxes and social security contributions they pay to the social and economic development of the Member States and the European Union. The EU needs these workers for demographic and skills-related reasons, just as it needs migrant workers more generally, and they must be guaranteed fair and decent working conditions. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">In order to protect the rights of seasonal workers, steps must be taken – in particular as regards working conditions – to ensure that the principle of equal treatment of third-country seasonal workers and national of the host Member State is fully respected. The full observance of this principle is also a prerequisite for avoiding social dumping and unfair competition. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Moreover, housing is a key aspect of the decent living conditions which seasonal workers should be able to enjoy: such workers should be guaranteed ‘adequate accommodation’, and this term needs to be defined more clearly. It is also important to ensure that seasonal workers are not exploited by being obliged to pay an excessively large proportion of their net income in rent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Monitoring is also important. Steps must be taken to set up effective and thorough inspection and monitoring mechanisms and to develop an effective means of facilitating complaints. The authorities responsible for monitoring action taken under this directive should be provided with all the resources they require to carry out their duties as effectively as possible. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; text-align:center; "><span style="font-weight:bold; ">SHORT JUSTIFICATION</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">There is a structural need for seasonal employment in the European Union not only in view of the demographic challenges it is facing and its ageing population, a situation which is likely to grow worse in future, but also because of a significant shortage of labour in this sector. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of seasonal employment sets out common EU admission and residence requirements, as well as the rights of seasonal workers from third countries. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">With regard to the proposed directive, the rapporteur of this opinion is concerned with gender mainstreaming welcoming, on the one hand, the incentives offered for circular migration while, on the other, expressing deep concern at the vulnerability of many seasonal workers, particularly women.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Despite the difficulty in compiling precise statistics, it is clear that women make up a substantial percentage of the migrant population, something which must be taken fully into account in order to manage effectively migration flows specifically conditioned by seasonal employment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">In many countries women are particularly vulnerable as a result of poverty, coupled with inadequate insurance cover, welfare benefits, skills (training) and financial resources, as well as being insufficiently well informed about their rights. Furthermore, they are confronted with prejudices and stereotyping based on gender, race and religion, as well as other forms of discrimination. All these and other related problems make life even harder for women employed as seasonal workers, particularly if they have other responsibilities such as caring for underage children.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Female seasonal workers are frequently employed for farm work during the planting and harvesting seasons and in the tourist sector during the holiday periods. However, they are in many cases given additional tasks not provided for in their seasonal employment contracts, including domestic work or caring for elderly or disabled persons or children. Existing inequalities in respect of pay or the terms and conditions of seasonal employment should not be perpetuated as a result of fluctuating demand for migrant seasonal workers as a specific category, the particular incentives and guarantees offered to them or the challenges facing them. Particular mention must be made in this opinion of the need to protect children living in the accommodation provided, as well as ensuring full compliance with health and safety requirements in respect of migrant seasonal workers who are pregnant, have just given birth or are breastfeeding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">Women employed as seasonal workers must be aware of their rights, the terms of their seasonal employment contracts and the nature of the tasks they are being called upon to perform, so that they are not obliged to work longer hours than they wish as household staff or carers, or be forced into trafficking and/or prostitution. Women in seasonal employment are frequently more vulnerable, since they are unaware of complaints mechanisms or are reluctant to make use of them for fear that this will adversely affect their future employment prospects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">It is therefore necessary to set out clearly the rights and obligations of seasonal workers in those sectors of the economy which fulfil seasonal employment criteria, so as to prevent arbitrary or inadmissible working conditions or exploitation. It is also necessary to provide a secure system of legal protection for seasonal workers, together with coordinated measures and regular inspections by the authorities in order to establish binding minimum standards regarding acceptable pay, accommodation and sanitation. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The relevant details concerning conditions for entry and residence, comprehensive information regarding workers’ rights and all necessary documentation should be available in the language of the seasonal workers and provision made for the services of an interpreter, so that even illiterate workers, particularly women, can be given all possible assistance in fully comprehending their rights, making it easier for them to seek legal redress for infringement thereof, ill-treatment or sexual or other forms of exploitation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">This opinion must also stress the need for every effort to be made to empower women in seasonal employment by means of education/training and support programmes specially tailored to their needs. Use of the appropriate instrument and exchange of good practices between the EU Member States and coordinated actions by trade union or other organisations in third countries could achieve an ongoing and systematic improvement in their knowledge and skills, greater mobility and improved ‘circular migration’ to the benefit of the EU, third countries and the seasonal workers themselves. The objective is, on the one hand, to improve productivity, competitivity and economic development in the Member States for the effective promotion/realisation of the EU 2020 strategy objectives, seeking to achieve a more social Europe and, on the other, to afford protection for third country nationals in seasonal employment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">In addition, this opinion must underline the need for the adoption of gender budgeting in drawing up and implementing national budgets, so as to ensure, on the one hand, the availability of sufficient funding and, on the other, the accurate monitoring and evaluation regarding the effectiveness of targeted programmes and incentives to protect the rights of permanent and seasonal workers and to strengthen social cohesion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0pt; margin-right:0pt; ">The systematic compilation of statistical data for seasonal migration in respect of women provides the most rational basis for the mobilisation of suitable policies to meet the challenges and problems arising from seasonal migration.</p>
