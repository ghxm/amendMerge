This revision will have implications for all concerned: the pharmaceutical industry, the generic medicinal products industry, doctors, pharmacists, veterinarians, distributors of medicinal products, national agencies and, of course, users.</p>
<p class="text-left">At first sight, the interests of these different categories may appear to clash. But there are many areas where their interests coincide, so that it is possible to find an optimum balance between competitiveness, research, health system needs and the development of generic medicinal products. This, at all events, is the main aim here.</p>
<p class="text-left">At present, there are two procedures for registering medicinal products: the centralised procedure, managed by the European Agency, under which authorisations valid for all EU Member States are issued, and the mutual recognition procedure, for which the Member States have jurisdiction. The current system seems to work satisfactorily. There is no need to alter the existing dual structure, and the main task is to optimise the way it works.</p>
<p class="text-left">Community provisions concerning the placing on the market of veterinary medicinal products are, in the majority of cases, comparable, or even identical, to those concerning medicinal products for human use. The veterinary medicines sector is, nevertheless, characterised by several specific features.</p>
<p class="text-left">Firstly, it must be recalled that veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animals may be authorised only under conditions which guarantee that the food produced is totally safe for consumers. Regardless of the provisions relating to the use of such medicinal products by practitioners and farmers, it is for manufacturers to provide any necessary information in advance concerning possible residues of such medicinal products in products derived from the animals treated with them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Secondly, the availability of certain medicinal products is a growing problem (cf. communication from the Commission to Parliament and the Council on this subject in December 2000<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part6_ref1" href="#_part6_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 6.1">[1]</a>). Animals which are to be treated, in particular breeding stock, have a limited economic value, whilst their owners must bear all the costs incurred. Moreover, some markets are restricted owing to the number of animal species concerned, the size of the population of the animals concerned, the huge range of diseases or the diversity of regional situations.</p>
<p class="text-left">The general aims and the provisions associated with the authorisation and use of medicinal products, in particular when it comes to ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of such products, are similar in both the public health and veterinary health sectors, and the parallel approach adopted by the Commission in its proposal should therefore be maintained as far as possible.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Generic medicinal products</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The term 'generic medicinal products' has been introduced for the first time. The concept of generic medicinal products and of Community harmonisation for ten years as regards administrative protection of data is clarified. Obviously, your rapporteur is aware of the usefulness of generic medicinal products and of the important role that they play in Europe's health systems. The approach adopted by the Commission to facilitate their access to Community markets is, therefore, a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="text-left">In order to submit an application for market authorisation, an applicant first needs to carry out extensive research in order to discover either new molecules or an innovative therapeutic use for an existing medicine. Research and development lay the foundations for health protection. We all know that innovation comes at a price. It is thus our duty to prevent Europe's industries from falling too far behind in terms of innovation, and they should be placed in a position to boost their ability to compete with the United States and the countries of Asia.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Provisions specific to the veterinary sector relating to marketing authorisation</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Where no authorised medicinal products exists for a given species or condition, it is proposed that the use of other, existing products should be facilitated. This measure is intended to help partly resolve the problem of the availability of certain veterinary medicinal products. It is thus proposed that there be clearer differentiation in this regard between provisions relating to non food-producing animals and those relating to food-producing animals.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the case of non food-producing animals, it is planned to maintain the cascade system, under which it is possible to use, in the following order, either another veterinary medicinal product, or a medicinal product for human use, or a veterinary medicinal product authorised in another Member State, or, lastly, a preparation made up at short notice.</p>
<p class="text-left">The 10-year protection period would be extended by one year if authorisation is extended to cover another food-producing species or to cover another condition (up to a maximum of three additional years for three or more species), provided, however, that such extensions are authorised in the three years following the original authorisation. This measure is designed to encourage an industry which has developed a new medicinal product for a species which constitutes a key economic sector to extend the authorisation for that medicinal product very quickly to cover other species which account for a smaller market.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>Pharmacovigilance</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The issuing of authorisation for a medicinal product does not, however, mean that checks are no longer needed on its efficacy and safety. We are all mindful of the recent examples of medicinal products withdrawn from the market on public health grounds. It is thus essential to step up pharmacovigilance requirements, i.e. the ongoing monitoring of a medicinal product, if the existence of European health system is to offer patients the best possible guarantees. Such monitoring activity will need to be taken into account properly when budgetary resources are allocated to the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="text-left">Quality guarantees are essentially based on a quality assurance system, including compliance with good manufacturing practices, and on the monitoring of the conformity of all provisions by the competent authorities, in particular by means of inspections. Such general measures apply to medicinal products for human use and to those for veterinary use.</p>
<p class="text-left">The significance of enlargement must also be emphasised. There is no hiding the fact that the revised text which will be adopted will also apply to the new Member States. Each new Member State will have an important role as a fully fledged player in the establishment and development of a Europe where health is to the fore and which we all wish to see come about.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Budgets appointed Wilfried Kuckelkorn draftsman at its meeting of 22 January 2002.</p>
<p class="text-left">It considered the draft opinion at its meeting(s) of 19 June 2002.</p>
<p class="text-left">At the last meeting it adopted the following amendments unanimously.</p>
<p class="text-left">The following were present for the vote: Terence Wynn, chairman; Anne Elisabet Jensen vice-chairman; Wilfried Kuckelkorn, draftsman; Ioannis Averoff, Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg, Joan Colom i Naval, Den Dover, Göran Färm, Neena Gill, Catherine Guy-Quint, Jutta D. Haug, Juan Andrés Naranjo Escobar, Joaquim Piscarreta, Giovanni Pittella, Guido Podestà, Ralf Walter and Brigitte Wenzel-Perillo.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">On the basis of the financial statements annexed to the three proposals, and which foresee no significant budgetary impact, the rapporteur has concentrated his amendments on the proposal to adapt the operational structure of the agency.</p>
<p class="text-left">With regard to the global contents of the proposal, of which the objective is to guarantee a high level of human and animal health protection through increased market surveillance and a stepping up of pharmacovigilance procedures, the rapporteur is concerned about the future costs that new activities entrusted to the Agency might generate for heading 3 of the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="text-left">He therefore suggests requesting an evaluation following the entry into force of these new regulations in order to assess the needs of the agency and to possibly adjust the subsidy, taking in account the level of the fees.</p>
<p class="text-left">In this context, he also wishes to recall the principles traditionally supported by the committee on budgets and which are reflected in the amendments:</p><ul class="d-table mb-1 pl-2"><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">new initiatives (including enlargement) should not be financed through a reduction of existing policies;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">the budgetary authority decides on the amount of the subsidy within the annual procedure;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">the Agency implements Community policies (linked to the achievement of the internal market) and receives public funding to do so; therefore principles of budgetary transparency should be ensured;</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell"><span class="mr-1">∙</span></span><span class="d-table-cell">the Agency Management Board must adjust the draft work programme and draft budget of the subsidy decided by the budgetary authority which implies selecting priorities to be financed within the Agency's financing capacities.</span></li></ul>

<p class="text-left">The Committee on Budgetary Control appointed Jan Mulder draftsman at its meeting of 21 February 2002.</p>
<p class="text-left">It considered the draft opinion at its meetings of 15 April, 23 May and 19 June 2002.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In drawing up its proposals, the Commission has recognised a number of specific features to the veterinary sector, notably that there is a need to address a growing shortage in veterinary medicines. It also recognises that a significant proportion of veterinary medicines are administered to food-producing animals, with a potential impact on safety to humans.</p>
<p class="text-left">With respect to this latter point, this is reflected in the Commission’s proposals to strengthen the record keeping requirements of the Directive and also the sections relating to pharmacovigilance.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is not clear, though, whether the proposal to give all medicines for food-producing animals prescription-only status will bring significant benefits in consumer protection. The main instruments to ensure that veterinary medicines do not endanger EU citizens are the Maximum Residue Limit and withdrawal periods. However, requiring all medicines to be available only on a prescription will not assist in upholding these standards, since it is the farmer not the vet who must enforce them.</p>
<p class="text-left">There is, moreover, a danger that, in some countries, the proposal would increase the cost of medicines to the farmer and could therefore, in certain cases, discourage the use of appropriate treatment. This could have serious implications for animal welfare. It is important that what, in certain countries, is a significant sector of the veterinary pharmaceutical industry, with a proven track record, is able to continue to operate. The system currently operating in some EU countries, where qualified professionals are authorised by the Member State to supply certain medicinal products, without the need for a veterinary prescription, appears to work effectively. There is little justification in preventing it.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission’s proposal to harmonise the period of data protection for new products is an important step towards establishing a fully operating Internal Market in pharmaceuticals. Extending the use of a veterinary product to new species requires a significant investment from the applicant, particularly in establishing Maximum Residue Limits. An additional period of data exclusivity of up to three years does seem to be a reasonable incentive for this work.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, the requirement for this additional period to be granted within the first 3 years of a marketing authorisation is unrealistic given the way in which veterinary products are developed. The returns from a product are often reinvested into developing the same medicine for alternative species.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission proposal for a “Bolar” provision, which allows research into generic products whilst the reference product is still patent protected, is an important development.</p>
<p class="text-left">Without a “Bolar” provision, research into generic products will still take place during the patent period, but the research will be undertaken in countries outside of the European Union, depriving Member States of the economic benefits that this work would bring. Much of this generic research currently takes place in the candidate countries. Without a “Bolar provision” this work may be lost.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission’s proposal to abolish the five-year renewal process is a move that will reduce the administrative and financial burdens placed upon the pharmaceutical industry. This should be welcomed, provided that the pharmacovigilance provisions proposed by the Commission are sufficient to ensure continued high levels of health protection. The removal of the renewal may be of benefit by preventing the loss from the market of rarely used medicines.</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal to invalidate authorisation for products that have not been placed on the market for two years does not seem to be a sensible alternative to the five-year renewals and should not be supported. It will not assist in getting products to the market more quickly and at worst could result in Member States being unable to respond to an outbreak of a rare disease. The Commission should reconsider whether the existing proposals on pharmacovigilance and periodic safety update reports will be sufficient in ensuring health protection following the abolition of the five year renewal.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development appointed Robert William Sturdy draftsman at its meeting of 8 January 2002.</p>
<p class="text-left">The committee considered the draft opinion at its meetings of 19 March 2002, 28 May 2002 and 19 June 2002.</p>
<p class="text-left">At the last meeting it adopted the following conclusions unanimously.</p>
<p class="text-left">The following were present for the vote: Joseph Daul, chairman; Albert Jan Maat, vice-chairman; Robert William Sturdy, rapporteur; Gordon J. Adam, Carlos Bautista Ojeda, Arlindo Cunha, Christel Fiebiger, Francesco Fiori, Christos Folias, Jean-Claude Fruteau, Georges Garot, Lutz Goepel, Willi Görlach, Liam Hyland, María Izquierdo Rojo, Elisabeth Jeggle, Salvador Jové Peres, Hedwig Keppelhoff-Wiechert, Heinz Kindermann, Dimitrios Koulourianos, Astrid Lulling (for Neil Parish), Véronique Mathieu, Hans-Peter Mayer (for Michl Ebner), Xaver Mayer, Karl Erik Olsson, Mikko Pesälä, Encarnación Redondo Jiménez and Agnes Schierhuber.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission’s proposals for amending the regulatory framework for the approval of veterinary medicinal products in the EU acknowledge the lack of availability of veterinary medicines and are a positive step forward in addressing this problem.</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposals recognise the need for veterinary medicinal products in ensuring the health and welfare of animals. They take into account animal health and welfare as well as public health, whereas previously the system has focussed exclusively on public health with little regard for the health and welfare of animals. A licensing system that takes into account both these requirements will bring back the much-needed balance, to the benefit of people and animals.</p>
<p class="text-left">In recognising the lack of availability of veterinary medicines, the proposals give some welcome suggestions for improving the system of registration, allowing medicines to be approved efficiently while at the same time ensuring that only safe, efficacious and high-quality medicines reach the marketplace. An improved system would achieve this without an overly burdensome procedure – what the Commission has called “cutting red tape.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission’s proposals offer special provisions to increase medicines availability for horses not intended for the human food chain as well as other animals such as rabbits and ferrets.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission’s proposals offer extended data protection to increase the incentives for companies to invest in producing new medicines for animals. They offer special protection for medicines developed for fish and bees, which currently face the worst medicines availability crisis.</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposals remove the administrative requirement to re-license products every five years, instead proposing a strengthening of the existing in-use monitoring and reporting system. This is coupled with proposals for extended record-keeping for treatment of animals destined for the food-chain, aimed at supporting full traceability throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="text-left">Overall, the Commission’s proposals will achieve the following:</p>
<p class="text-left">-   They will support the welfare and safety of humans. Consumers expect that animals, whose produce they eat, are free of disease;  the public should be protected from diseases that can be passed on to humans;  and farmers should be able to have access to registered and approved safe, efficacious and high-quality medicines should their animals fall ill.
<br /></p>
<p class="text-left">-   They will support the welfare of animals. By encouraging innovation they will encourage new treatments, enabling animals to have access to the medicines they need to stay healthy or be treated if they become sick.</p>
<p class="text-left">-   They will encourage and enable companies to continue to invest in research and development in order to bring new treatments to the market, and stay ahead of the spread or emergence of new diseases. Keeping research and development facilities in Europe will safeguard jobs and keep Europe as a centre of innovation.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission’s proposals aim at making practical improvements to the system for scrutinising, evaluating and approving veterinary medicinal products based on 20 years of experience of the current system. In general, they propose welcome measures to increase transparency and ease of use of the system, making it less burdensome, less cumbersome and less time-consuming while at the same time protecting the interests of members of society and animals.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, the Commission’s proposals have some major weaknesses that could undermine the practical effectiveness of the solutions proposed.</p>
<p class="text-left">They do not reflect an understanding of the length of time it takes to obtain registration and to develop the data required for the extension of a marketing authorisation to different species and to different sicknesses, whether for a food-producing animal or not.</p>
<p class="text-left">They do not fully recognise that the number-one focus must be solving the medicines availability crisis by getting products to the market at the same time as ensuring no lapse in existing provisions for human and animal safety.</p>
<p class="text-left">They do take into account the fundamental nature of the animal-health markets. Due to the species-specific, regional and often sporadic nature of animal diseases, the markets are, in practice, tiny when compared to those for human pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p class="text-left">Animal medicines must be licensed to similar standards of quality, safety and efficacy as human pharmaceutical products, yet the economic realities of the potential marketplaces mean that it may not be economically feasible to bring them to market. A great many veterinary medicinal products are “orphan drugs” when the criteria for human pharmaceutical products are applied in the same manner.</p>
<p class="text-left">Therefore the draftsman would propose a series of amendments that would address these problems without compromising human health or animal health and welfare.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>AMENDMENTS</strong></p>
