<p>The proposal for a Directive concerning the quality of bathing water (COM(94)0036 - 94/0006(SYN)) replaces Directive 76/160/EEC of 8 December 1975<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref1" href="#_part3_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.1">[1]</a>. The proposal has three important objectives: to simplify, clarify and qualitatively alter the existing Directive. The latter was, after all, adopted 21 years ago, and numerous problems have arisen with its implementation. Although in theory the Member States should have implemented it within two years, it was not until 1990 that it was transposed into the legislation of all Member States. At present such problems still persist as inefficient transposition (by circular in France and the UK) or inadequate transposition (failure to carry out the required purification measures in Italy), but fundamental problems also exist, as is very apparent from the Commission's reports on the quality of bathing water. In other words, the checks required by the Directive are not carried out in respect of enough bathing waters, too few samples are taken, the number of parameters checked for is inadequate, bathing water is of poor quality, exemptions from analyses are granted without justification, etc.</p>
<p>The proposal thus seeks to remedy these shortcomings and thereby bring about effective application of the Directive.</p>
<p>Moreover, Directive 76/160/EEC is out of date because in the past 20 years progress has been made with physico-chemical and above all microbiological analysis techniques. During this period, much epidemiological research has been carried out with the aim of defining pollution indicators which are as reliable as possible. This has made it necessary to review the parameters for assessment of the quality of bathing water used in this Directive.</p>
<p>Lastly, the proposal introduces important innovations into the Directive in the form of the requirements concerning public information. These provisions on the one hand accord with the policy initiated in 1990 by Directive 90/313/EEC regarding freedom of access to environmental information<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref2" href="#_part3_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.2">[2]</a> and on the other hand</p>
<p>take into account the growing awareness of the quality of the environment on the part of bathers and tourists. For the above reasons, the Commission proposal is welcome and the Committee on the Environment can only applaud it. However, a number of points require clarification, there are grounds for certain minor criticisms, and some amendments need to be tabled.</p>
<p><strong>I. THE PURPOSE OF THE DIRECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>In the preamble, the Commission indicates that the Directive has the aim of protecting the environment and public health and developing tourism, while a subsidiary aspect is the completion and operation of the internal market.</p>
<p>The quality of bathing water and information about it are indeed an element in the development of tourism. Every tourist is naturally interested in information about the quality of the environment in which he intends to spend his holiday.  On the other hand it cannot be taken for granted that the local authorities will have the courage to publish information which leaves room for doubt as to the quality of bathing water, thereby running the risk that bathers and tourists may stay away.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur considers that the objectives regarding protection of the environment and health are important. An analysis of the proposal, and particularly the omission of physico-chemical parameters for heavy metals in water, indicates that its primary aim is to protect not the environment but the health of bathers. By eliminating from the proposal aspects focusing more on the environment, the Commission has sought to simplify matters and reduce the costs arising from analyses not directly related to health, and it wishes to stress the fact that the physico-chemical analyses it has omitted are hardly ever carried out.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur considered the idea that the proposal could therefore be based on Article 129 of the Maastricht Treaty, but decided against it because in that case Member States would hardly have any scope for adopting stricter standards than required by the Directive.</p>
<p>In due course the ecological quality of water must be guaranteed by the framework directive on European water policy. Nonetheless, the bathing water Directive certainly will affect the ecological quality of water. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Directive, the competent authorities must periodically identify all discharges. They must then take appropriate measures to prevent such pollution. The measures to be taken pursuant to Article 6 will therefore genuinely affect water quality.</p>
<p>It follows that the bathing water Directive should be incorporated into the framework directive when the latter is adopted. However, it does not seem desirable to await the framework directive before considering the present proposal. Firstly, research has shown that Directive 76/160/EEC is scientifically out of date and has therefore become virtually impossible to implement, so that any delay would be difficult to accept. Secondly, the Commission has the option of reviewing Directive 76/160/EEC under the commitology procedure, in other words without consulting Parliament. In order to prevent this, it would be best to complete as quickly as possible the procedure which began in 1994.</p>
<p><strong>II. A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS</strong></p>
<p>(a) <u>The definition of bathing water</u> (Article 1(2)(a)), which is the same as in the existing Directive, is inadequate because it is imprecise. The term 'a large number of bathers' is extremely vague, and has led to major discrepancies between Member States as regards the number and delimitation of these waters. In 1995 Ireland, for example, listed 189 bathing waters, whereas Denmark listed 1299. In this case the difference cannot be attributed to a significant difference in climate. The judgment given by the Court of Justice in Case C-56/90, Commission of the European Communities v. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, indicates clearly how much discretion the Directive gives the Member States in interpreting the definition - discretion which can be exercised in a manner dictated by interests which do not necessarily correspond to those of bathers.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur has tried to find a less vague definition, which would give the  Member States less room for interpretation. He proposes 'many bathers'.</p>
<p>(b) <u>The definition of 'bathing season</u>' adds to this confusion. So far it has been left to local or regional authorities to determine how long the bathing season lasts. It is surprising to find that the bathing season is shorter in France than in Denmark. Of course it would be impossible to insist that the length of the season should be the same in all Member States. Even so, the definition can be tightened up, and a minimum of 2 months laid down.</p>
<p>(c) <u>The assessment of compliance of bathing water with the requirements of the Directive</u> as provided for in the new Article 5(1) seems more appropriate than that in Directive 76/160/EEC. Firstly, the definition is simple. It is based on a single clear criterion: for each parameter, the number of samples which do not comply with the values in force must not exceed a particular number stated in the Annex.</p>
<p>However, the proposal introduces a new category, 'bathing water of excellent quality'. Is this an attempt to link the measures to the 'blue flag' campaign<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref3" href="#_part3_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.3">[3]</a> which becomes more popular with bathers with each year that passes, and indeed with local authorities?</p>
<p>This new category could cause confusion among consumers. If water complies with the Directive and is of adequate quality, bathers can swim in it safely. What are consumers then to make of water of 'excellent' quality? It is enough to describe this category of water as being 'of good quality': this will sufficiently enable bathing resorts which meet the necessary conditions to beat their drum and outcompete resorts whose bathing water is less good, and there will be less confusion among consumers.</p>
<p>(d) <u>Public information</u>, as referred to in Article 5(4), is to be welcomed. Of course, implementation must be monitored, but it is to be hoped that local authorities which are keen to cultivate the trade of tourists will wish to disseminate reliable, readable and readily accessible information.</p>
<p>(e) <u>The lack of harmonization of sampling methods</u> is one of the weak points of the proposal. It now becomes clear why it is difficult to compare and verify the accuracy of sampling results, which leads to problems of harmonization of the annual reports which the Member States are required to submit (Art. 11).</p>
<p>Although Article 6(2) of the proposal indicates clearly when the sampling, analyses and inspections should begin and where they should be carried out, nothing is said about the conditions under which they should take place. If we wish to have reliable data, the sampling must be carried out in accordance with current scientific standards (time of sampling, temperature at which samples are kept, maximum cooling temperature, exposure to light, etc.). A code of good practice for the sampling of bathing water must therefore be drawn up and approved in accordance with Article 10 (management committee procedure).</p>
<p>Moreover, wherever possible the description of the sampling technique should refer to CEN methods. This should be laid down in Annex I.</p>
<p>(f) The proposal does not assign any role to the <u>European Environment Agency</u>. Although carrying out inspections is not yet part of the Agency's remit, it may well be in the future, and this would probably be desirable. In that case, the Agency should also carry out its remit in respect of this Directive.</p>
<p><strong>III. CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ANNEXES</strong></p>
<p>Annex I contains the real meat of the proposal. It comprises a table of parameters for assessing the quality of bathing water, accompanied by mandatory values (I) and guide values (G). There are many changes in comparison with Directive 76/160/EEC. Some microbiological parameters have been altered, some mandatory or guide values have been changed or supplemented, and some physicochemical parameters have been dropped.</p>
<p>(a) <u>Microbiological parameters</u></p>
<p>* Inspection for total coliforms: this is dropped completely, as these bacteria are not a reliable indicator of faecal contamination, and it is therefore unnecessary to test for them.</p>
<p>* Inspection for faecal coliforms: there is no satisfactory method of carrying this out in Europe. It has therefore been replaced with a count of Escherichia coli: since there is an almost perfect correlation between the presence of faecal coliforms and E. coli, this method is the most reliable available at present. Counting E. coli is not intrinsically very relevant, as E. coli has little or no pathogenic effect on human beings and therefore presents no direct threat to the health of bathers. However, it is of interest as a first indication of faecal contamination. The presence of more than a certain level of E. coli may indicate the presence of other bacteria or viruses which are pathogenic but are harder to detect directly (because methods of analysis are  non-existent, complex, unreliable or too time-consuming).</p>
<p>* Inspection for faecal streptococci: these have been stepped up (adoption of a mandatory value of 400 per 100 ml and fortnightly sampling frequency). Faecal streptococci cause urogenital and endocardial infections. Thus they also constitute an indicator of faecal contamination. In certain cases their presence can be linked to the presence of the E. coli, while in others it cannot. Despite this partial overlapping, counting them is still of use in studying bacterial contamination due to the resuspension of sediment (a frequent phenomenon in bathing water).</p>
<p>Some people consider the mandatory value (I) of 400 per 100 ml scientifically ill-founded.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur proposes deleting footnote 1 to Annex I concerning analysis of faecal streptococci. The reason for this is that this exception has been found to give rise to many cases of fraud. Although the Commission could carry out an investigation if the footnote were applied regularly, in practice the Commission is rarely, if ever, informed of its application, and monitoring is therefore impossible.</p>
<p>* Inspection for enteroviruses: this is retained in the proposal, and a minimum sampling frequency is laid down (once per month). This is because it is important to detect the presence of enteroviruses, as they cause many serious infections such as polio or hepatitis A. However, analysis is expensive and the method of detection is not genuinely reliable. The new proposal therefore  provides for this analysis to be replaced by detection of bacteriophages in future. Bacteriophages are pathogenic viruses of bacteria. They cannot survive if the cells which they parasitize are no longer present. Thus the presence of bacteriophages in bathing water implies that the bacteria are also present, including pathogenic bacteria. It is assumed that it will be easier and less expensive to detect these bacteria than enteroviruses. However, much progress still remains to be made here, both as regards standardization of the method and as regards setting the standards. The proposal for the revision of Directive 76/160/EEC does not yet propose much in this respect.</p>
<p>As far as enteroviruses are concerned, the mandatory value of 0 PFU/10 litres, combined with monthly sampling, seems impractical for many. It is statistically unlikely that bathing water sampled monthly will not contain any enteroviruses at all.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur therefore proposes deleting the enteroviruses from Annex I, but incorporating in Article 6(3) a requirement that if identification of pollution sources in the vicinity suggests that contamination with enteroviruses is likely, tests must be carried out for them.</p>
<p>* Inspection for salmonella has been dropped, although salmonella bacteria cause serious diseases such as typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever, as well as toxic infections of the intestines, which can be fatal to children and the elderly. In its Explanatory Memorandum the Commission justifies the omission of this parameter by stressing firstly that salmonella bacteria are virtually impossible to monitor, as they may enter bathing water in a great variety of ways, and secondly that a very high concentration of these bacteria needs to be present in the water before any danger of infection arises, and that there is therefore no serious danger to health. Moreover, in the Commission's view, the risk of salmonella bacteria is covered by the requirement in Article 6(3) for all Member States to identify all discharges which could result in salmonella bacteria entering bathing water and adopt appropriate measures to prevent pollution from such sources. Moreover, in cases in which salmonella infection occurs, Article 7(1) is applied, requiring bathing to be prohibited where a threat to public health exists.</p>
<p>(b) <u>Physico-chemical parameters</u></p>
<p>* First eight parameters: these are retained and hardly altered. In the proposal for a Directive, all are now assigned a fixed I (mandatory) value, while some are also assigned a G (guide) value. Methods of analysis remain unaltered, as do sampling frequencies, except in the case of mineral oils (reduced from fortnightly to monthly).</p>
<p>* Measurement of pH: the aim is to determine the acidity of the environment. Living organisms can only survive in a buffered environment, i.e. one in which pH fluctuations are very slight. Strong fluctuations kill organisms and render all life impossible.</p>
<p>* Dissolved oxygen: the presence of a certain quantity of dissolved oxygen is essential in order for aquatic fauna and flora to survive.</p>
<p>* Presence of surface active substances: these substances, derived from cleansing agents, are one of the principal sources of pollution which promote eutrophication.</p>
<p>* Presence of phenols: phenols are very strong disinfectants. Their presence may possibly indicate previous destruction - and elimination - of bacteria which has not, however, destroyed pathogenic viruses.</p>
<p>* Presence of mineral oils: the presence of a layer of mineral oils on the surface of the water prevents gas exchange with the atmosphere.</p>
<p>* Presence of floating materials: this parameter makes it possible to gain an impression of water quality by looking for coarse elements on the surface. Under the proposal, water is to be rejected for bathing purposes (I value) only if it contains sewage solids. However, your rapporteur considers that other floating materials may also constitute a hazard to bathers. Some flexibility is naturally called for in applying this criterion, as water is of course hardly ever completely free of floating objects.</p>
<p>* Colour and transparency: both these parameters make it possible to gain a general impression of the degree of eutrophication and the sediment present, i.e. the possible reduction in water quality.</p>
<p>The main new aspect lies in the omission from the proposal of the last 6 parameters (ammonia, nitrogen Kjeldahl, pesticides, heavy metals, cyanides, nitrates and phosphates). Their presence is no longer to be monitored at fixed intervals but only if water quality declines or there is a tendency towards eutrophication. Moreover, these substances are not dangerous to bathers if the bathing water is used only for recreational purposes: they are purely indicators of environmental pollution. As point out above, the environmental aspects have been eliminated from the proposal for a Directive, and your rapporteur therefore considers the omission of these 6 parameters acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>This revision of Directive 76/160/EEC is necessary for scientific reasons. The existing Directive is out of date in the light of scientific progress, and there are serious problems with its implementation. However, the revision of the Directive must not result in any reduction in the protection of bathers and the environment. Your rapporteur believes that the amendments tabled will ensure that these requirements are met without the Member States having to incur large implementation costs.</p>
<p>However, this proposal is only one element in Community legislation on water quality. After the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 and in response to pressure from the European Parliament, Community legislation on water quality is currently undergoing a general revision; care must be taken to ensure that it does not result in reduced protection of the environment. The revision is mainly necessitated by the lessons learnt from the inconsistent application of the Directives by the Member States, but also by the considerable costs involved in implementation.</p>
<p>Community legislation on water quality needs to be revised, but the revision must not be based primarily on economic considerations: it should take as its starting point a thorough analysis of the general water problem and the various human activities on water, and their intensity and nature. It is regrettable that the Commission has not yet adopted a more systematic approach to water policy, which ought to begin by determining the general principles and strategies to be adhered to, followed by proposals appropriate to the various types of water, particularly drinking water, surface waters, bathing water, etc.</p>

<p><u>Subject</u>: <strong>Proposal for a Council Directive concerning the quality of bathing water - (COM(94) 36 final - C4-0036/94)</strong></p>
<p>Dear Mr Collins,</p>
<p>At its meeting of 19 October 1994, the Committee on Budgets considered the above-mentioned proposal.</p>
<p>This proposal, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, defines the objectives which must be achieved to guarantee satisfactory bathing waters, while leaving the Member States free to chose the means of achieving those objectives.</p>
<p>The Committee on Budgets noted that this proposal involves operating expenditure (Line B4-304) and administrative expenditure (Line A-2510).</p>
<p>With regard to the operational aspects of the proposal, the committee decided, in line with its usual practice, not to accept the management committee envisaged in Article 10.</p>
<p>The Committee on Budgets also decided not to accept the estimated administrative expenses, in accordance with its 1995 budget guidelines on Line A-2510 and on the use of internal redeployment.</p>
<p>It was also of the opinion that Parliament should be provided with more information.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Committee on Budgets makes its favourable opinion subject to acceptance of the two attached amendments.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection</p>
<p>Draftsman: Mr Petrus A. M. Cornelissen</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p>
<p>At its meeting of 2 December 1994 the Committee on Transport and Tourism appointed Mr Cornelissen draftsman.</p>
<p>At its meetings of 1 February, 22 February and 23 March 1995 and 2 October 1996 it considered the draft opinion.</p>
<p>At the last meeting it adopted the conclusions unanimously.</p>
<p>The following took part in the vote: Parodi, acting chairman (for Cornelissen, chairman and draftsman); Lüttge, vice-chairman; Belleré, Danesin, González Triviño, Grosch, Koch, Mendonça (for Farassino), Pelttari, Piecyk, Puerta (for Moreau), Rehder (for Megahy), Schlechter, Sisó Cruellas, Stenmarck, Stockmann, Tamino (for van Dijk), van der Waal and Wijsenbeek.</p>
<p><strong>I. </strong><u><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></u></p>
<p>Council Directive 76/160/EEC of 8 December 1975<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref1" href="#_part5_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.1">[1]</a> concerning the quality of bathing water, which has been in force for 15 years, has ensured the constant monitoring of bathing water - with the exception of water intended for therapeutic purposes and water used in swimming pools - as a means of protecting the environment and public health in tourist resorts.  Such monitoring is based on specific parameters and values which the 16 000 bathing areas currently covered by the directive must comply with during the tourist season.  The application of the directive has resulted in a clear improvement in the quality of the bathing water in the areas in question.</p>
<p>Over the years the directive has undergone several modifications but its substance has remained unchanged.  The revisions were made following, firstly, the Act of Accession of Greece of 28 May 1979, Annex I, Chapter XIII, paragraph 1(a)<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref2" href="#_part5_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.2">[2]</a>, and then the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal of 12 June 1985, Annex I, Chapter X, paragraph 1(b)<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref3" href="#_part5_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.3">[3]</a>, Directive 90/656/EEC<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref4" href="#_part5_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.4">[4]</a> on the transitional measures applicable in Germany with regard to certain Community provisions relating to the protection of the environment, Directive 91/692/EEC<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref5" href="#_part5_def5" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.5">[5]</a> on standardizing and rationalizing reports on the implementation of certain Directives relating to the environment and, lastly, the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden of 16 May 1994, Annex VIII, point A, paragraph 1<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref6" href="#_part5_def6" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.6">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of the Fifth environmental action programme entitled 'Towards sustainability'<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref7" href="#_part5_def7" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.7">[7]</a> - which stresses that the safety and quality of bathing waters are important assets for tourism - the Commission has submitted the proposal in question<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref8" href="#_part5_def8" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.8">[8]</a> with the aim of updating and clarifying Directive 76/160/EEC.</p>
<p>The proposal introduces several changes.  Firstly, it sets out to adapt both the 'pollution indicators' and the methods of analysis or inspection to scientific and technical progress.  These indicators and thus represented by 12 parameters - as opposed to the 19 parameters at present - with values above which the presence of pathogenic substances is indicated; they are the same as those adopted by the ISO (International Standards Organization).  The Member States are, however, free to set more stringent values and to set values for parameters not included in Table 1 of Annex I.</p>
<p>As an incentive for Member States to improve their bathing areas, the directive introduces a distinction between bathing waters which comply with the directive and those with a standard of 'excellent quality', in other words, waters which, during a bathing season, comply with values which are superior to the normal values (Annex I, Table 1, column G) and whose maximum number of samples which need not conform to such normal values corresponds to Table 3 of Annex I.  The samples must be taken 30 cm below the surface of the water.</p>
<p>The Member States must therefore ensure that information on bathing water quality is prominently displayed at each bathing area.  They must also identify all discharges and sources of pollution which are likely to affect the quality of bathing water, particularly those which might lead to salmonella reaching bathing areas.  Unlike the current rules, deviations from the values set by the directive will be permitted only for the amount of time necessary to restore the quality of the water.  In the event of any threat to public health, the Member States may prohibit bathing and shall inform the Commission thereof.</p>
<p>With effect from the 1996 bathing season, Member States shall send a report on the implementation of the directive.  New bathing areas, i.e. those which fall within the scope of the directive for the first time, will have to conform to the values set by the directive with effect from the 1998 bathing season.</p>
<p>Over the course of 1995, Parliament and the Council called on the Commission to submit a document setting out a global Community policy for the water industry.  Consideration of the proposals already submitted, including the present proposal on bathing water, was accordingly suspended.</p>
<p>The communication in question represents action on that request, setting out the objectives and principles of a sustainable long-term policy for the water industry and indicating that there will be a proposal for a framework directive on water resources, which will not, however, affect the directive on the quality of bathing water (Directive 76/106/EEC).</p>
<p>2. <u>ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSAL</u></p>
<p>The Committee on Transport and Tourism naturally welcomes the proposal in question, which constitutes a step forward in the process of monitoring bathing water in the Community's tourist resorts.  The tourism industry can only benefit from this, as the provisions will help to ensure that tourists continue to visit resorts which are already popular, thereby cutting down on the unnecessary 'consumption' of coastal areas that are still unspoilt.</p>
<p>The committee still has doubts about the over-narrow definition of bathing water, given the new forms of water-based tourism, despite the fact that the Court of Justice, in its judgment of 14 July 1993 (Commission v United Kingdom in Case 56/90) gave guidelines for interpreting this notion.</p>
<p>However, our main criticism concerns the low legislative profile of the directive.  The problems of the pollution of bathing water and increasing mass water-based tourism are not tackled adequately or in any depth.</p>
<p>The directive confines itself to introducing the concept of 'excellent quality' bathing water as an incentive for tourist areas (the only 'prize' being that such areas will be given a special mention in the annual reports published by the Commission)  and fails to link this to the principle of aid for the environment pursuant to Regulation  (EEC)  No.  1836/93 on a Community ecomanagement and audit scheme<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref9" href="#_part5_def9" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.9">[9]</a> , as requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 15 December 1994<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref10" href="#_part5_def10" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.10">[10]</a>  on Community measures affecting tourism.</p>
<p>In this connection the directive does not attempt, for example, to bring the 'Blue Flag' campaign within the ambit of the Community and award the Blue Flag to bathing areas which meet the directive's requirements.  This initiative is currently being promoted by the Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe (FEEE), which receives Community support.  The Commission is involved in drawing up the criteria on the basis of which the  'Blue Flag'  is awarded and is represented on the board.</p>
<p>Another crucial factor, which is not taken into consideration at all, is the requirement that Member States should promote a European tourism label (similar to the 'eco-label') for bathing areas which meet the required quality standards laid down by the proposal for a directive and that the directive should form the basis on which to regulate the growing mass market for water-based tourism.</p>
<p>All the above requests have been incorporated in the report<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref11" href="#_part5_def11" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.11">[11]</a> of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the first multiannual programme to assist European tourism - 'PHILOXENIA'<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part5_ref12" href="#_part5_def12" aria-label="Go to footnote 5.12">[12]</a>, which could serve as a reference point for the experimental development of monitoring policies for bathing water in tourist locations.</p>
<p>III. <u>CONCLUSIONS</u></p>
