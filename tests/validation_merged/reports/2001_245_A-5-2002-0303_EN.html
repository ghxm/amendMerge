<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   <u>Legal basis</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The proposed Directive aims at establishing an EU-wide market for GHG emissions. This Directive being part of the EU's climate-change policy package and being a tool for achieving an environmental objective (the reduction of GHG emissions), the proposed legal basis is Article 175(1) TEC.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   <u>Economic basis of the emissions trading scheme</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">When the Kyoto Protocol comes into force the external costs of global warming will be reflected in all products.</p>
<p class="text-left">Although the emissions trading scheme does not itself reduce GHG emissions, it enables reductions to be made in sectors, businesses and processes in which costs are lower. This reduces the overall cost of meeting the environmental target. Whether they are buying or selling, companies benefit from the flexibility available without doing any damage to the environment. It may be recalled that emissions trading is one of the Kyoto Protocol's three flexible market mechanisms and is due to be launched in 2008.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>3.</strong>   <u>Directive on emission allowance trading – summary of the Commission proposal</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The European emissions trading scheme will be launched in 2005 and will involve nearly 5000 European companies (large individual sources) within the industry and energy sector which account for over 46% of all EU carbon dioxide emissions. The scheme will serve the following purposes:</p>
<p class="text-left">-   it will give EU companies practical experience prior to the 2008 launch of the international emissions trading scheme (as set out in the Kyoto Protocol);</p>
<p class="text-left">-   it will speed up action to remedy, with effect from 2005, the current state of affairs in which most of the Member States fail to honour their commitments under the Burden Sharing Agreement;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   it will achieve a significant reduction (in the region of billions of euros per year) in the cost of honouring the commitments made by the EU in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur welcomes the introduction of an emissions trading scheme in the European Union but considers that four conditions must first be met:</p>
<p class="text-left">-   As the EU strives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a balance must be struck between the emissions trading scheme and other policies and measures, such as the promotion of renewable energy sources, of energy efficiency, of organic farming and of public transport, together with the introduction of a tax on transport-related energy use and carbon dioxide emission and an emphasis on research into new types of engine and new fuels, so as to ensure consistency with the EU's pronouncements on the subject during the international negotiations on the Kyoto protocol;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   It must be ensured that emissions reduction policies apply across the board to all sectors of the economy. In addition to legislation applicable to industrial installations and the energy production sector (which are covered by the Directive under consideration here), other legally binding Community instruments must be developed and implemented in respect of other industrial units and the services, agriculture, domestic and – above all – transport (in which EU emissions are forecast to increase by over 50% in the next ten years) sectors;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   Common coordinated climate-change policies and measures must be accompanied by quantified reduction commitments and timetables for implementation;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   Common coordinated climate-change policies must at one and the same time serve to ensure that environmental targets are met and that the internal market is not distorted.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>4.</strong>   <u>Gases and sectors covered</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Under the proposal for a Directive (Annexes II and I thereof) the scheme is restricted to only one of the greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide – and to the energy (combustion, refineries, coke ovens) and industrial (ferrous metals, paper and minerals) sectors.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur considers it important for other greenhouse gases and other industrial sectors (such as chemicals, non-ferrous metals and semi-conductors) to be included in the Directive at the earliest possible stage.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, this will occur only if and when the following two requirements are met: firstly, enlarging the scope for the directive must not lead to such a large increase in the number of installations as to jeopardise the simplicity of the scheme; secondly, other gases may be included only if the same guarantees regarding transparency in respect of measurement, monitoring and the forwarding and verification of data can be offered as the existing ones relating to carbon dioxide (as laid down in Annexes IV and V).</p>
<p class="text-left">In view of the fact that these conditions have not yet been met, the Commission is called upon to develop the methodologies necessary to ensure that other gases and other sectors can be included when the Directive is revised in 2004.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>5.</strong>   <u>Allocation of emission allowances</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>(a)      Method</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">For the 2005-2007 period the Member States shall, pursuant to the proposal for a Directive, allocate emission allowances to operators free of charge in the form of 'grandfather' rights based on an historical level of emissions to be established by each Member State. For the second period (2008-2012), the Commission intends to establish a harmonised method (which, however, it does not describe in detail).</p>
<p class="text-left">Since it involves no cost, the proposed method has the virtue of not imposing on operators, at the time of the initial allocation, what would be regarded, in the absence of other policies, as a new tax. However, it does have other shortcomings which need to be remedied: (a) it does not incorporate the 'polluter pays' principle; (b) it is unfair to operators who initiated emission reductions at any early stage; (c) it makes it difficult for new companies to enter the market; (d) it may lead to distortions in the market as a result of the use of different reference years by Member States; (e) it does not enable an immediate idea to be gained of the value on the market of an emission allowance unit.</p>
<p class="text-left">With a view to remedying these drawbacks the rapporteur is proposing that, during the initial period (2005-2007), emission allowances should be allocated on the basis of a hybrid method: the Member States would allocate 70% of emission allowances free of charge on the basis of the emissions recorded in 1990 (the Kyoto Protocol reference year) and the remaining 30% would be allocated by means of an auction. For the second period covered by the scheme, the rapporteur proposes that all emission allowances should be allocated by means of an auction.</p>
<p class="text-left">In neither period should the second the allocation of allowances place any burden on the budget, for which reason the Member States, acting in accordance with environmental criteria, would redistribute the proceeds from the auction to the companies participating in the scheme.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>(b)      Total quantity of emission allowances</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Article 9 of the Directive states that it is for the Member States to decide what quantity of emission allowances to place on the market, whilst Annex III lays down the criteria to be observed in the allocation of this total quantity of emission allowances to operators.</p>
<p class="text-left">Two problems stem from the Commission proposal: (a) the directive does not set quantified annual in-house gas reduction targets to be achieved in the Community and the Member States by means of the emissions trading scheme; (b) the fact that the Member States are free to choose the quantity of emission allowances they wish to place on the market is highly likely to distort competition on the internal market on account of possible over-allocation to centre sectors or operators in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="text-left">With a view to remedying this situation, the rapporteur has tabled amendments to Article 9 and Annex III, by means of which a ceiling is placed on the emission allowances to be allocated by each Member State. That ceiling represents 50% of the emissions forecast annually for each Member State on a linear curve converging with the Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>5.</strong>   <u>Compatibility with other national greenhouse-gas reduction policies</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Although your rapporteur understands the difficulties which some Member States will experience in bringing their policies into line with the new Directive, he agrees that the emissions trading scheme should be legally binding (as proposed by the Commission) and he opposes converting the scheme into a voluntary one (by means of an opt-out clause), since such flexibility would:</p>
<p class="text-left">-   distort the internal market;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   reduce the amount of experience gained by European companies prior to the introduction of the international emissions trading scheme;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   reduce the economies of scale made possible by the scheme and consequently increase the cost of EU compliance with the Kyoto Protocol (it should be borne in mind that, in a study<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part6_ref1" href="#_part6_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 6.1">[1]</a> recently published by the Commission, it was estimated that implementation of the Directive would have the effect of reducing the cost of compliance by half);</p>
<p class="text-left">-   reduce the environmental benefits of the scheme;</p>
<p class="text-left">-   require alternative means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to be developed, such as a tax on energy use and carbon dioxide emission, which in economic terms would be less flexible than emissions trading.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>6.</strong>   <u>Interlinking with the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal for a Directive is silent regarding the possibility for operators to spend their emission allowance credits on projects carried out under the Kyoto Protocol flexible instruments, in particular the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) (involving the granting of emission credits to operators who develop clean projects in developing countries) and Joint Implementation (JI) (involving the granting of emission credits stemming from projects between developed countries).</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur considers that this situation needs to be clarified. Hence, during the first period covered by the Directive (2005-2007) prior to the launch of the international emissions trading scheme in 2008, there must be a complete ban on the use, under the Directive, of emission allowance credits, since the purpose of the Directive is to reduce emissions within the European Union.</p>
<p class="text-left">With effect from the second period covered by the Directive (which coincides with the launch of the international emissions trading scheme provided for in the Kyoto Protocol), the use of emission credits earned from CDM and JI projects should be allowed under the Directive, provided that the projects involved do not include carbon sinks or sources of energy production which use fossil fuels or nuclear power.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Introduction</p>
<p class="text-left">Under the Kyoto Protocol, the European Community has undertaken to cut back its emissions of greenhouse gases by 8% by 2008 to 2012 as compared to the1990 level. In the spring of 2000, the Commission published a Green Paper setting out the possibilities offered by trading in greenhouse gas emission allowances for helping meet requirements under the Kyoto Protocol. The emissions trading instrument emerged as the most effective method of reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Commission proposal</p>
<p class="text-left">The purpose of the Commission proposal is to establish a market for big energy users. The Commission has incorporated into its proposal a number of points set out in the relevant resolution adopted by Parliament<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part7_ref1" href="#_part7_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 7.1">[1]</a>. However, in a number of areas the Commission proposal is still unclear.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ceilings</p>
<p class="text-left">There are various methods for determining the standard to be met in pursuing the goal of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> levels. An absolute ceiling may be set, clearly indicating how many tonnes of CO<sub>2 </sub>may be emitted by a Member State. It is also possible to apply a relative ceiling. Here, the setting of efficiency objectives for companies may be taken as the basis, with emissions required to be reduced per unit of product. Growth in production may, in this case, result in an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Given the commitment to achieve CO<sub>2</sub> reduction targets, it is important that an absolute ceiling is laid down for emissions. It is desirable that this absolute ceiling is fixed at European level. Total CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions in the Community must not exceed this ceiling. Under this approach, referred to as a ‘cap and trade’ system, it is possible to be certain about achieving the environmental objective, provided, of course, that the arrangements are properly enforced and monitored.</p>
<p class="text-left">Allocation</p>
<p class="text-left">Your rapporteur supports the proposal by the Commission that allowances should initially be allocated free of charge. For reasons of clarity, it is also preferable that the necessary allowances be provided free of charge in the subsequent period.</p>
<p class="text-left">The auctioning of initial allowances must be regarded as a form of taxation if the revenues produced are not offset through taxation. In order to prevent revenues from auction from having to be compensated via national taxation, it is also important that allowances are allocated in the subsequent period on the basis of a performance standard. Apart from other difficulties, it is technically too complicated a business to offset in a fair and equitable way revenues produced through auction. It should also pointed out that it is essential that companies are clear and certain well in advance about the possibilities available to them for CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Market in emission allowances</p>
<p class="text-left">The way in which the market is to be organised is not laid down by the Commission but left to those offering and buying allowances. Member States have a significant role to play in this connection. It is important that the conditions under which the market is to operate are harmonised in the Member States. That means that taxes must not be allowed to hinder the proper functioning of the internal market. The directive also lays down penalties to be imposed in the event of emission allowances being exceeded.</p>
<p class="text-left">In addition to the market in emission allowances, the Commission intends in future to propose an energy tax to be applied in sectors which do not participate in the market for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, the energy tax complementing emission trading.</p>
<p class="text-left">Penalties</p>
<p class="text-left">We support the Commission's proposal to leave the imposition of penalties to the Member States. This means, however, possible differences in the way in which penalties are treated in terms of their impact on companies’ profits. Penalties are to be imposed in the form of a fine. The fiscal treatment of penalties must not be allowed to distort competition.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is desirable that Member States report on the fiscal treatment of the costs of penalties and the purchase of additional allowances in relation to profits. Fiscal compensation of national industry with the effect of disrupting the internal market should be avoided.</p>
<p class="text-left">Conclusions</p>
<p class="text-left">The introduction of a market for greenhouse gas emission trading will ensure that a price becomes attached to emissions of these gases. This will create a permanent financial incentive to reduce emissions. In addition, it will be necessary to work on developing new, cleaner technologies.</p>
<p class="text-left">The ultimate goal is a better environment for human beings, animals and plants to live in. Humans have been given the duty by their Creator of managing creation responsibly. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions helps fulfil part of that responsibility.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p>

Thyssen, Rijk van Dam (for Ole Krarup) and Rainer Wieland.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   Legal basis</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The proposed Directive aims at establishing an EU-wide market for GHG emissions. This Directive being part of the EU's climate-change policy package and being a tool for achieving an environmental objective (the reduction of GHG emissions), the proposed legal basis is Article 175 (1) TEC , as was called for in the EP resolution of 26 October 2000 on the Green Paper on GHG emissions trading within the EU.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   Coverage of gases</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Under the draft Directive, emissions trading will start in 2005, covering in its first stage 45% of the EU's CO2 emissions and would be mandatory for most large CO2 emitters (4.000 to 5.000 large industrial and energy installations across the EU). The draft Directive leaves open the possibility of further gases being included through an amending proposal, which will fall under the co-decision procedure. A mandatory scheme with no opt-out ensures the widest possible market and low costs with few free riders and guarantees minimal distortion of the internal market.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your draftsman favours extending the scope of the Directive from the beginning to other GHGs for which EU-wide measuring is possible. In the long run, the inclusion of all other Kyoto-gases will offer more low-cost mitigation options, thus increasing the efficiency of the scheme.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>3.</strong>   Allocation method</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Under the proposal, each affected installation will require a permit to emit GHGs. A permitholder needs to match its emissions with tradable allowances that are allocated by the Member States. If a company emits in excess of its allowances, it must purchase additional ones from the market to match the additional emissions or pay a penalty, while companies that reduce their emissions by more than the allocated cap can sell the surplus of allowances to other companies or may bank them for later use. The Commission proposes that during the initial period 2005-2007 allocation would be done by each Member State for free according to a national allocation plan that must be approved by the Commission to ensure compatibility with the internal market and competition rules. As the Kyoto commitments will start in 2008, the Commission intends to specify a harmonised method of allocation for the 2008-2012 period.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your draftsman is of the opinion that pure grandfathering (allocation to companies for free, based on historical emissions) is not an acceptable method for allocating allowances to firms because it does not reward early action and does not sufficiently reflect the polluter pays principle. A mix of grandfathering and payment (auctioning) could provide more justly a level playing field for companies that also accommodates new entrants. Such a hybrid scheme would allow both Member States and affected entities to thoroughly prepare themselves for the actual implementation of the Kyoto Protocol commitments from 2008. This is in line with the 2000 EP resolution on the Green Paper, and should achieve the desired environmental outcome and minimise distortion of competition.</p>
<p class="text-left">Furthermore Member States should recycle revenues from payments making this allocation method budgetary neutral.</p>
<p class="text-left">To ensure the environmental outcome of the future emissions trading scheme, your draftsman further prefers defining an EU cap for emissions under this Directive from 2008 onwards.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>4.</strong>   Links with other GHG emissions trading schemes</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission's proposal is envisaged as an EU-wide internal environmental policy instrument but provides the possibility to link up with domestic trading schemes of particular countries via the mutual recognition of each scheme' s allowances in agreements concluded with these countries.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your draftsman is not against project-based mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol as such, but in line with the EP resolution on the Green Paper, is of the opinion that they should not be considered within the scope of this Directive but should be left to the scheme arising from the enforcement of Kyoto mechanisms. Since project-based mechanisms risk undermining the environmental goal and the economical functioning of emissions trading, your draftsman would like to clarify that this draft Directive does not foresee the inclusion of credits from project-based mechanisms (such as CDM and JI under the Kyoto Protocol).</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>1.) The Commission proposal</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The emission trading scheme proposed by the Commission covers carbon dioxide emissions from large stationary sources covering the power and heat generators, oil refineries, ferrous metals, cement, lime glass and ceramic material, pulp and paper. It is estimated that the sources covered will emit 46% of the Community´s carbon dioxide emissions in 2010. National authorities will issue site-specific greenhouse gas emission permits to installations setting requirements for monitoring and reporting emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="text-left">A key issue is the allocation of emission allowances to installations. According to the Commission proposal Member States will allocate allowances, based on a national allocation plan developed in accordance with common criteria. Three months after the end of each year, operators will be required to hand over allowances equivalent to the installation´s emissions during the preceding year to the national authority. Operators of installations will be free, if they so wish, to buy or sell their allowances. If an operator of an installation can reduce emissions (for example by increasing energy efficiency), the excess allowances can be traded for a profit.</p>
<p class="text-left">Member States will have to apply harmonised non-compliance penalties of 100 Euro per tonne of excess emissions or twice the market price, and a requirement for the shortfall to be made up.</p>
<p class="text-left">In this way, emissions reductions shall be achieved where it is most economically efficient for them to take place right across the EU.</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal is for EU-wide emissions trading to start in 2005. After this period of 2005-2007 allocation of allowances will take place for five-year periods. In the initial period, all allowances will be allocated for free. For the five-year period beginning 1 January 2008 and all following five-year periods the Commission shall specify a harmonised method of allocation in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 23(2) of the proposal (comitology-procedure).</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>2.) Key issues</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">On 6 February 2002, the European Parliament, by 540 votes to 4 with 10 abstentions, approved the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Kyoto Protocol, insisting that the burden sharing agreement concluded in June 1998 be fully observed.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission proposal is in line with this decision. It tackles the emission problem at EU level in order to avoid distortions of the internal market by national emission schemes introduced by single Member States. Such a EU-wide approach is particularly necessary in view of the completion of the internal market in electricity and gas.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course, an international scheme including the EU´s major trading partners must be the objective the Commission and the Council have to continue to aim at. Nevertheless, the EU has to fulfil its commitment and to set the base for an efficient system reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This cannot be reached by the sole means of a voluntary scheme.</p>
<p class="text-left">A key issue of this proposal concerns the method of allocation: for the three period beginning 1 January 2005 the Commission proposes that Member States shall allocate allowances free of charge. For all following five-year periods a harmonised system of allocation will have to be adopted separately. As this harmonised system will be of utmost importance it is essential that certain principles of this harmonised system are already laid down in the framework of the present directive. It is also important that the harmonised system is not adopted through a comitology procedure as suggested by the Commission but through a normal legislative procedure which is subject to the democratic control by the EP.</p>
<p class="text-left">The harmonised system shall respect the following principles:</p><ul class="d-table mb-1 pl-2"><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">*</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">Allocation should be made by Member States, but giving the Commission an over-all coordinating function.</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell pb-1"><span class="mr-1">*</span></span><span class="d-table-cell pb-1">It is essential to give credit for reductions in emissions already achieved by certain Member States or industries.</span></li><li class="d-table-row"><span class="d-table-cell"><span class="mr-1">*</span></span><span class="d-table-cell">Any distortions across the single market must be avoided as well as distortions from other energy-saving measures introduced by individual Member States.</span></li></ul>
<p class="text-left">The review of the present directive will have to take into account as much as possible the experience and requests put forward by the concerned economic sectors.</p>
<p class="text-left">After consulting the relevant industries it should be possible to include other activities than those mentioned in Annex 1. Other greenhouse gases than CO 2 mentioned in Annex 2 should be included at a second stage if they can already be accurately measured.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>3.) Conclusions</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Internal EU emissions trading should significantly reduce compliance costs for reaching the Kyoto targets and, as such, is a cornerstone in a cost-effective implementation strategy. It will provide an economic incentive to increase efficiency as it will be possible to sell a surplus of allowances on the market.</p>
<p class="text-left">A European framework is needed to prevent different and potentially incompatible national schemes that would fragment the internal market and lead to distortions of competition. It has to take duly into account the reductions in emissions already achieved by certain industries in certain Member States.</p>
