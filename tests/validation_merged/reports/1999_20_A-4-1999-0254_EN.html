<p>The European Parliament and the European Union have for years attached great importance to preserving the environment, and especially in the developing countries.</p>
<p>The main instruments laying down the EU's development aid policy give prominence to the production of cooperation schemes in the environmental field.</p>
<p>This is true of the fourth Convention of Lomé in particular, in respect of the ACP countries, of Regulation 443/92 on financial and technical cooperation with the countries of Latin America and Asia and the financial protocols flanking the cooperation agreements with the Maghreb and Mashreq countries.</p>
<p>This priority for the protection of the environment has been supplemented in recent years by the increasing realisation of the need to foster sustainable development.</p>
<p>The European Parliament, following a report by its Committee on Development and Cooperation, declared itself in favour of the implementation of schemes in the developing countries which would contribute to their sustainable development<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref1" href="#_part3_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>This concept of sustainable economic and social development is now enshrined in Article 130u of the TEU. The conclusions of the June 1998 Cardiff European Council referred to the priority to be given to protecting the environment with a view to ensuring sustainable development<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref2" href="#_part3_def2" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.2">[2]</a>. Similarly, the European Parliament and Council decision of September 1998 stressed their shared attachment to the pursuit of the goal of sustainable development especially as regards international cooperation and development policy<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref3" href="#_part3_def3" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1992, at Parliament's instigation, the EU budget contains a new line, supplementing existing instruments briefly described above, concerning the environment in the developing countries.</p>
<p>The creation of this budgetary line met the need both to stress the high priority attached by the EU to this field and to provide additional funding in a sector where the need for cooperation schemes and funding is especially large.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this budgetary line, B7-6200, was initially provided by a Council regulation of April 1997, which will expire at the end of 1999<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref4" href="#_part3_def4" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.4">[4]</a>. This proposal is intended to extend the process.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, 1997-1999, budgetary line B7-6200, Environment in the developing countries, has been allotted ECU 46 m in commitment and ECU 34.5 m in payment appropriations. For 1997, 24 projects were funded, 16 of them in the ACP countries, four in Latin America, three in Asia and one in the Maghreb. An overall assessment of the operations conducted by the EU under this regulation and this budget line is now in progress.</p>
<p>In essence the new proposal follows on from the 1997 regulation on which Parliament delivered an opinion under the same two-reading cooperation procedure which will be followed in this case, after a report by its Committee on Development and Cooperation<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part3_ref5" href="#_part3_def5" aria-label="Go to footnote 3.5">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>We would point out with regret that a number of Parliament's amendments at that time which were not taken up by the Council have not been incorporated in the new proposal either.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur considers that the Committee on Development and Cooperation's guidelines and priorities voiced in 1996 and espoused by Parliament were basically justified and relevant. They are worth retabling now.</p>
<p>This is especially true of the need to ensure optimum coordination between the various policies and instruments deployed, to foster greater regional cooperation and to ensure that there is an environmental dimension to all development projects.</p>
<p>As to the priority fields, the reference made in the past to town and country planning and transport, renewable energy sources, hazardous substances and toxic waste, environmental standards, and to the impact of population growth and migration on the environment should be reintroduced.  Besides reintroducing the priority actions voiced in 1996 this list of priority fields should also be extended to soil degradation, the management of wetlands, environmental problems related to industrial activities, waste water treatment, the promotion of sustainable trade and non-sustainable forms of agriculture.  Special attention should be given to the relation between poverty and environmental degradation.  Emphasizing this relationship in the regulation is particularly important as article 130 U of the TEU identifies poverty alleviation as one of the main goals of the EU development policy.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur also hopes that this proposed regulation, which will now be open-ended, will contain a definition of the term sustainable development.</p>
<p>Your rapporteur also wants to introduce the concept of the "demand-approach" as an extra criterium for the eligibility for funding.  In this approach the Commission should take into account the demands of the actors in the developing countries.  As the amount of ECU's allocated to this budget-line is limited it should be spent in an efficient manner.  One method to reach this objective is to take the demands of the people living in the developing countries into careful consideration.  This to ensure that the needs of these people are not only fulfilled on paper but also in reality.</p>
<p>Finally amendments have been tabled that ask for a more transparent and flexible implementation of the directive as your rapporteur believes that this will enhance the effectiveness of the directive.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>(Rule 147)</p>
<p>for the Committee on Development</p>
<p>on the proposal for a Council Regulation on measures to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries</p>
<p>(COM(99)0036 - C4-0130/99 - 99/0020(SYN); report by Mrs. van Putten)</p>
<p>Committee on Budgets</p>
<p>Draftsman: Mr. Carlos Pimenta</p>
<p><em><strong>Procedure</strong></em></p>
<p>At its meeting of  9 March 1999 the Committee on Budgets appointed Mr. Pimenta draftsman.</p>
<p>It considered the draft opinion at its meeting of 18 March 1998.</p>
<p>At the last meeting it adopted the following conclusions  unanimously</p>
<p>The following were present for the vote: Samland, chairman; Tillich and Giansily, vice-chairmen; Pimenta , draftsman; Dankert, Dührkop Dührkop, Garriga Polledo, Ghilardotti, Haug, KellettBowman (for Bardong), McCartin, Virrankoski, Wynn.</p>
<p><em><strong>Background</strong></em></p>
<p>This Regulation shall form the legal basis for Budget heading B7-6200 ("Environment in the Developing Countries"). The current legal base, Regulation 722/97 of 22 April 1997<em><strong>, </strong></em>expires at the end of 1999. It foresaw a financial reference amount of ECU 45 million for the period 1997 to 1999. Commitment appropriations of Euro 16 million have been included under heading B7-6200 for the year 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission has not included a financial reference amount in its proposal. This is in keeping with the inter-institutional declaration of 6 March 1995 on the incorporation of financial provisions into legislative acts<a class="erpl_smooth-scroll" id="_part4_ref1" href="#_part4_def1" aria-label="Go to footnote 4.1">[1]</a> which are not subject to the codecision procedure. This approach can be supported by Parliament. In keeping with the Treaty, it is the budgetary authority which decides, on an annual basis, the level of financial resources to be allocated to the activities concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the new Regulation be implemented for a period of unlimited duration, but foresees a review of operations after four years. The Budgets Committee reminds the Commission of its obligations under Article 3 of the Financial Regulation to provide to the budgetary authority, when the preliminary draft budget is drawn up each year, a cost-effectiveness analysis enabling a comparison to be made between the development of appropriation requirements and the estimates contained in the financial statement attached to the proposal. If necessary, the Commission can also present a revised financial statement to the budgetary authority together with the preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p>The Commission should in particular inform the budgetary authority of any change in its requirements for technical and administrative assistance so that a proportion of the total annual funds can be authorised for such expenditure (currently in the 1999 budget authorised for an amount of EURO 640 000 or 4 % of total commitment appropriations).</p>
<p><em><strong>Amendments proposed</strong></em></p>
<p>The rapporteur proposes three main modifications :</p>
<p>- <u>commitology</u> : clarification of Parliament's support for the Advisory Committee procedure as the most appropriate for a spending programme since it is fully in accordance with Art. 205 of the Treaty (the Commission is responsible for implementing the budget) ;</p>
<p>- <u>finance</u> : statement of Parliament's view, without naming an actual figure, that the amount allocated to these activities under the previous Regulation represents the absolute minimum level of funding for the budgetary authority in its annual decisions on the budget;</p>
<p>- <u>scope of the Regulation</u> : the rapporteur suggests that the scope of the Regulation could be extended to cover not just activities in developing countries but also the integration of the environmental dimension into EU development and external policies. The extension of the Regulation in this way is neutral in its impact on the budget. All the rapporteur suggests is that the Commission begins work on this aspect of Articles 130W and 130R. of the Treaty by conducting an environmental audit of external policies in the course of 2000. Such an audit could be combined with further initiatives for the "greening" of the budget, and the rapporteur hopes that the Committee on Development will respond positively to this idea.</p>
<p><em><strong>Conclusions</strong></em></p>
<p>17. Following the above remarks, the rapporteur requests the Committee on Development Relations to adopt the following amendments:</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless"><tr class="text-center"><td class="w-50"><p>Commission proposal</p></td><td class="w-50"><p>Amendment</p></td></tr></table></div><p class="text-center"><strong>(Amendment 1)</strong></p><p class="text-center"><strong>Title of the Regulation</strong></p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless"><tr><td class="w-50"><p>Proposal for a Council Regulation on measures to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries.</p></td><td class="w-50"><p>Proposal for a Council Regulation on measures to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension <u>in EC external policies and</u> in the development process of developing countries.</p></td></tr></table></div><p class="text-center"><strong>(Amendment 2)</strong></p><p class="text-center"><strong>Recital (7)</strong></p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless"><tr><td class="w-50"><p>Whereas the European Parliament and the Council <u>adopted on</u> 24 September 1998 <u>the review</u> of the European Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development "Towards sustainability", calling for a strenghtened role for the Community in international cooperation in environment and sustainable development;</p></td><td class="w-50"><p>Whereas the European Parliament and the Council, <u>by decision of</u> 24 September 1998, <u>adopted a revised version</u> of the European Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development "Towards Sustainability", calling for a strenghtened role for the Community in international cooperation in environment and sustainable development;</p></td></tr></table></div><p class="text-center"><strong>(Amendment 3)</strong></p><p class="text-center"><strong>Recital 7a (new)</strong></p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-borderless"><tr><td class="w-50"></td><td class="w-50"><p><u>Whereas the basic strategy of the Programme is to achieve full integration of environmental policy in other policies, including development policy ;
