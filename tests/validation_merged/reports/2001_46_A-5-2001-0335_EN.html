<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>1.</strong>   Introduction</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission’s proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is based on the generally accepted need for the Community to have an appropriate legal basis for this classification. Because of the lack of such a basis, the adjustment and updating of the system has until now been done by means of gentlemen’s agreements between the Member State concerned and Eurostat.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission says that regional statistics are ‘<em>a cornerstone of the European Statistical System</em>’ and has maintained and is continuing to use the existing classification established in the 1970s by Eurostat and based on a geographical division of territory, together with the current system for collecting data, whereby the national statistical bodies are responsible for providing regional data of interest to the EU, such as income or unemployment statistics and trends.</p>
<p class="text-left">At Community level, the data provided by the Member States are used as an objective statistical basis for very different purposes, some of which are of major political significance, such as determining zones eligible for structural funds or State aids.</p>
<p class="text-left">The objectives the Commission has set for its proposal are to fix the current state of the NUTS breakdown of regions in the Member States, define objective criteria for the definition of regions, ensure comparability and impartiality of regional statistics, define clear rules for future amendments of the NUTS breakdown and maintain the stability of the data.</p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal retains the division of the Member States’ territory into statistical units (NUTS) organised hierarchically in three levels, while proposing similar criteria for the definition of these regions in the applicant countries. With this in view, it wants these units still to be determined on the basis of territorial organisation and within existing population thresholds, which take into account the average population size of the regions in each Member State:</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody>

<p class="text-center">800 000</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p class="text-left">Each Member State is therefore subdivided into a number of NUTS 1 regions. Only three States, Sweden, Luxembourg and Denmark, form a single NUTS 1 region in themselves. NUTS 1 regions are then subdivided into NUTS 2 and these in turn into NUTS 3, in accordance with demographic criteria and existing administrative structures. Where no administrative structures exist, the requisite NUTS level is obtained by grouping together smaller units until the average population required is obtained.</p>
<p class="text-left">At NUTS 3 level, the average population size for all Member States corresponds to the range set in the proposal for a regulation, between 150 000 and 800 000 inhabitants. At level 2 there are two exceptions: Denmark, where the population is too high (in excess of three million) and Luxembourg, where it is too low (fewer than 800 000 inhabitants). Both States make up a single NUTS 2 region. At level 1 the exceptions are Greece, Luxembourg, Austria and Finland.</p>
<p class="text-left">In its proposal, the Commission has chosen to endorse the existing classification, which since the 1970s has been adjusted to cater for successive enlargements of the Community. Since population changes in the Member States occur slowly, the Commission does not see the need to change these criteria in the immediate future. The proposal provides for three-yearly reviews of the regulation to amend the classification. The annex includes a single change to the existing classification: at the request of the German Statistical Office, Berlin, which had previously been divided into two territorial units, Berlin East and Berlin West, has now become a single NUTS 3 unit.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.</strong>   Remarks on the proposal for a regulation</strong></p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.1.</strong>   Establishing a classification</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">As far as the territorial criterion is concerned, between State level and local administration level the Member States generally have two intermediate territorial units included under NUTS, in the form of regions and provinces/departments/Kreise. Although in some cases these have governments with legislative assemblies and powers over structural funds, in others they are merely a territorial division of the State administration. This produces units which are not homogeneous because they cannot be compared in terms of their political powers or spheres of responsibility.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission itself points out that, depending on the country, these units may be NUTS 1 and 2, 1 and 3, or 2 and 3, depending on the population brackets which it has arbitrarily set itself.</p>
<p class="text-left">Furthermore, because many Member States do not have any regional organisation, or because these regions or provinces do not reach the population levels laid down, there also exist artificial ‘non-administrative territorial units’, mainly at the NUTS 1 level.</p>
<p class="text-left">Only in Germany and Belgium do NUTS 1 units correspond to actual political regions. In France, Spain and Italy, despite the existence of a regional political breakdown, because of the strict application of the rule on average population size, many regions have had to be grouped together artificially in non-administrative units for the purposes of this level. The same has occurred in some regions of Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Finland.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, a detailed analysis of the classification shows that the Commission fails to apply its own criteria, since 41 of the current 78 NUTS 1 regions have fewer than 3 million inhabitants or more than 7 million. In reply to this the Commission has said that the NUTS 1 criterion is not all that important (sic).</p>
<p class="text-left">In addition, the fact that the demographic criterion was established by taking the national average and including it in such a broad range can only serve to remove any European added value from the proposal, which is in no way homogeneous.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.2.</strong>   Establishment of objective criteria</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">However, over the last thirty years the Community has increased from six members to fifteen, and we are now on the verge of further enlargements which could result in a Community of 28 Member States. It is therefore necessary not only to provide a legal basis for this nomenclature, but also to lay down objective criteria for the classification of units, so that the applicant countries have guidelines that will enable them to draw up an adequate classification for their own territory. Yet many of the existing NUTS divisions do not comply with the conditions that are to be imposed on the new Member States. The Commission argues that if they are being used it is not necessary to change them.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.3.</strong>   Comparability of statistics</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission is only partially achieving the objectives set for its NUTS breakdown. In fact, the territorial units listed in the annex are anything but comparable or homogenous, which could detract from their neutrality.</p>
<p class="text-left">A simply analysis of NUTS level 2 shows that, of the 184 units belonging to this level, 54 fall beneath the minimum of 800 000 inhabitants, while 20 exceed the ceiling of 3 million inhabitants.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>2.3.1.</strong>   <strong>The territorial factor</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">One of the criticisms that can be made of the proposal is the failure to include land area as a statistical criterion. This results in a major disparity in the size of the units and helps to conceal very important factors such as the low population density or gradual depopulation of certain areas. For example, level NUTS 1 includes the whole territory of Sweden (8 850 000 inhabitants and 410 000 km<sup>2</sup>) and the region of Brussels (950 000 inhabitants and 161 km<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p class="text-left">It is also significant that the level 3 territorial units in Germany (462) exceed the total combined number (444) for France (100), Italy (103), the United Kingdom (135), Spain (52), Netherlands (40), Luxembourg (1), Denmark (5) and Ireland (8).</p>
<p class="text-left">While recognising the difficulties of working with such disparate political and administrative units as a basis for compiling and processing statistical data, we believe it necessary to call on the Commission to include other criteria, so as to obtain a closer approximation to reality and more homogenous units.</p>
<p class="text-left">If the population size of the territorial units were similar, and account were taken of land area and the actual institutional, political and administrative situation, this would make the statistics more comparable and give them a higher public profile. The public find it very hard to identify with units which, apart from bearing no resemblance to reality, in some cases serve to conceal regional situations with serious shortcomings.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>2.3.2.</strong>   <strong>The population factor</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Article 3 of the proposal for a regulation allows the Commission to deviate from the population thresholds laid down therein '<em>because of particular administrative and geographical circumstances, to be appreciated by the Commission</em>' . The proposal refers to the <strong>average population size</strong> of the territorial units for each NUTS level in each Member State, which should be within the population thresholds laid down. Judging by the classification of Aland (25 000 inhabitants) as NUTS 1, 2 and 3, it can only be concluded that the Commission is exercising a great deal of flexibility in using this option.</p>
<p class="text-left">The outcome of the Commission proposal is a map of very different territorial units, as a result of the uneven population density. There are what might be called '<em>NUTS smallholdings</em>' in Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands and '<em>NUTS estates</em>' in Spain, Italy, Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong>2.3.3.</strong>   <strong>Other factors</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Article 2 of the Commission proposal refers to all level 1, 2 and 3 territorial units as '<em>regions</em>'. This leads to confusion, as in each Member State it is only <strong>territorial units at one level</strong> which are referred to as regions. The rapporteur is therefore proposing that the units at the three levels be referred to as 'territorial units'.</p>
<p class="text-left">Consideration should be given to the possibility of including a new level NUTS 4 in the regulation in future, situated between level 3 and the local administrative units, bearing in mind that Eurostat is already working with this concept. It should also be remembered that this level already exists as an administrative unit in some Member States (cantons in France, 'comarcas' and 'cabildos insulares' in Spain), and we believe that this could provide users with more useful information than the artificial aggregates that are the basis of existing NUTS 1 regions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Eurostat classifies <strong>local administrative units</strong>, generally municipalities, as NUTS 5, a highly detailed level, with more than 100 000 territorial units and subject to countless modifications every year.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, what is missing is the existence of genuinely European statistics able to underpin future political projects such as the ESDP. Europe at present is already witnessing regional phenomena such as the so-called '<em>blue banana</em>', which need to be analysed and studied from a supranational standpoint, and this will be even more pronounced following enlargement to the east.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>2.4.</strong>   Future changes</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">There is no doubt as to the political thinking behind the content of this proposal. Many European citizens cannot understand why certain very backward territorial units have never been eligible as Objective 1 regions because they are classified as NUTS level 3, whereas other units with considerably higher income have been eligible because they are classified as NUTS 2. On the other hand, provinces with more than 75% of the average Community GDP have benefited from the fact that other more backward provinces in their region have enabled the whole territorial unit to be classified as NUTS 2, making it eligible for Objective 1 states. Consequently, this is more than just a technical or statistical debate, since there are clear consequences according to which breakdown is used.</p>
<p class="text-left">Given that this regulation is being discussed at an important political juncture, on the eve of enlargement, and the impact of the technical proposals by the various national statistical offices, it is vital to ensure comparability and impartiality when establishing and using regional statistics, two requirements that are particularly important for the future regional funds and for identifying which regions are eligible.</p>
<p class="text-left">Because it is a regulation, the legislative initiative for amending it lies with the Commission. The Member States can indicate the changes they feel should be made and provide notification of any changes in existing administrative units.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>3.5.</strong>   Stability of data</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The Commission states that it is vital to define clear rules for future amendments of the NUTS breakdown, while ensuring that the classification enjoys a degree of stability and providing users with data that is stable enough for analysis, and is proposing that the classification be updated at intervals of not less than three years.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><strong>4.</strong>   Conclusions</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">1.   The rapporteur welcomes the initiative of setting down in a regulation the classification of territorial units for statistics, thereby providing it with a legal basis.</p>
<p class="text-left">2.   The rapporteur endorses the objectives put forward in the proposal, namely establishing comparable territorial units based on existing political and administrative units of similar population size, which can be used to develop a European statistical system.</p>
<p class="text-left">3.   She considers, nevertheless, that the breakdown contained in the proposal is not in keeping with these objectives and can be seen largely as an artificial division of European territory. The rapporteur notes that the annex to the Commission proposal merely lists the different territorial units existing in each Member State, together with other non-administrative units, which results in a lack of uniformity in the units as a whole.</p>
<p class="text-left">4.   The rapporteur believes that the proposal for a regulation should include a European approach that can go beyond the framework of the borders between the Member States and, with this in view, believes that the level NUTS 1 should take into account major territorial units which straddle these borders, to bring them within a future European spatial planning system.</p>
<p class="text-left">5.   The rapporteur considers it necessary to monitor the territorial divisions being developed in the applicant countries, so that they can be adapted to the new regulation.</p></div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div class="separator separator-dotted my-2"></div><div class="d-block d-sm-flex justify-content-between small mb-3"><span class="text-muted"></span><div><span><a href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></span></div></div></div></main><script src="/commonFrontResources/evostrap/5.0.0/lib/lib/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script><script id="evostrap" src="/commonFrontResources/evostrap/5.0.0/lib/dist/js/evostrap.js"></script><script src="/commonFrontResources/evostrap-doceo/1.1.1/dist/js/doceo.js"></script></body></html>
