<p class="text-left">The Commission considers that the recent emergence of transport companies that are not bound to a specific geographical area and operate in various Member States is the main reason for establishing its preference for ‘regulated competition’ in a new regulation. The rapporteur agrees with the Commission’s starting-point, that awarding transport areas to such companies should not depend on favouritism or judgments in the courts, but on objective standards and the principle of limited periods.</p>
<p class="text-left">The most important debating point is whether there is still room, in addition to the significantly increasing number of multinational companies, for the long-term continuance of area-bound companies in towns and regions. For London, Paris, Vienna, a large number of German cities, and the whole of public transport in Belgium and Luxembourg, the unamended adoption of this proposal will have serious consequences.</p>
<p class="text-left">Local authorities have in many cases in the past set up their own undertakings in order to safeguard continuity, improve quality and service provision, introduce innovations, improve working conditions, substantially reduce tariffs and keep better control over the award of large public subsidies to a loss-making industry. With the same aim they have also wholly or partially converted existing private companies. Including area-bound companies of this kind in the application of the rules proposed by the Commission threatens ultimately to put them out of business. Not because their work is poorer or more expensive, but because they can only survive provided that they obtain the resulting award of their domestic markets. If they lose the domestic market that was hitherto protected they will cease to exist, whereas a large company with several transport areas can offset the loss of one area by expanding elsewhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">The rapporteur takes the view that there should be more types of competition than merely having private contractors compete for government subsidies. It also concerns the competition between private cars and public transport, between different kinds of transport companies and different kinds of government policy. Apart from the multinational companies, area-bound companies must also be able to continue, in particular in the case of integrated networks with light rail transport in large cities and other densely populated regions. Companies of this kind are important for the expansion of tram and metro services, winning the competition against the car, meeting the objectives of environmental care and urban planning, introducing free public transport and being able to react quickly and flexibly to the constantly changing aspirations of the democratically elected people’s representatives for the region concerned. They ensure that the local authorities preserve the know-how to negotiate with other types of companies and also help ensure that the authorities are not obliged to set up expensive new control machinery themselves. From the point of view of subsidiarity and democracy there is a need to ensure that the authorities responsible for public transport are not able merely to choose between different competing tenderers. There also needs to be a choice between a commercial model, involving tendering, and public ownership of the transport system as a public service provision. The democratic bodies of each competent authority should be able periodically to choose between the system that the Commission is proposing and another, different, system.</p>
<p class="text-left">If two different kinds of company continue to co-exist they will keep one another up to the mark, their services can be compared and the pros and cons of each system are plainly visible to consumers and governments. To prevent the continuance of such companies from distorting the market outside their transport area, the rapporteur proposes that area-bound companies should not be able to participate in tender procedures elsewhere, by introducing a provision on reciprocity.</p></div><div class="separator separator-dotted separator-2x my-3"></div><h2 id="_section5">OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC AND MONETARY AFFAIRS</h2><div><p><strong>12 June 2001</strong></p>

Thyssen, Helena Torres Marques, Bruno Trentin, Theresa Villiers and Karl von Wogau.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>SHORT JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal under consideration provides for an instrument which is well-balanced overall and which, with due regard for the principles of subsidiarity and neutrality, will help to give a boost to the public transport sector and regulate competition in that sector, whilst also giving Member States' competent authorities the possibility of drawing up the public transport policies best suited to their needs and taking account of environmental and social factors.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, a number of improvements may be made to the proposal with regard to environmental protection, the protection of workers, the provision of information to users, competing operators and competent authorities, the continuity and quality of the public service, the maximum duration of contracts, the transitional period and various other points.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>1.</u>   <u>Environmental protection</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Firstly, reference should be made in the preamble to Article 6 of the Treaty, pursuant to which environmental protection requirements are to be taken into account in the definition of other Community policies, including transport policy. It should also be mentioned in the preamble that one of the proposed regulation's basic objectives is to help bring about a modal shift, i.e. from private cars and other motor vehicles to more sustainable modes of land transport.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lastly, Article 4 should specify that rational energy use is one of the environmental factors to be taken into account by competent authorities, and that the latter must, in any case, ensure compliance with a standstill requirement as regards environmental performance. The quality comparison procedure should also take account of environmental criteria.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>2.</u>   <u>Protection of workers</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The protection of workers must be taken into account when opening up the sector to competition. Article 9(3) of the proposal essentially stipulates on this subject that: 'Where a public service contract includes an exclusive right, the competent authority may require the selected operator to offer to staff previously engaged in providing the services the rights that they would have enjoyed if a transfer had occurred within the meaning of Directive 77/187/EEC'.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 3(3) of the above Directive that, in the event of an undertaking being transferred, the transferee is to abide by the terms of the collective agreements which were binding on the transferor, until those agreements expire or until a new collective agreement has been concluded. The second subparagraph of the same article lays down that Member States may limit the time for which this requirement applies to a minimum period of one year.</p>
<p class="text-left">In order to afford workers a reasonable level of protection in the context of liberalisation, it would be appropriate to strengthen the mechanism provided for in Directive 77/187 by making it clear in the Regulation that the competent authority may decide that the selected operator should be required, vis-à-vis workers previously engaged in providing the service, to abide by the provisions of collective agreements that were binding on the operator who has been replaced, even if the selected operator has concluded other agreements since taking on those workers, provided of course that such provisions are more favourable to the workers concerned. In such a scenario, however, competent authorities could not require compliance with such agreements for a period exceeding two years.</p>
<p class="text-left">The competent authority's scope for making use of Article 9(3) in cases where the public service contract does not provide for an exclusive right should then be widened.</p>
<p class="text-left">Moreover, it is advisable that competent authorities be made to require that the operator be established in the Member State in question, in order to ensure that the social legislation of that Member State is applicable to the workers concerned.</p>
<p class="text-left">It should also be made clear in Article 9(5) that the competent authority is entitled to demand the information needed for application of Article 9(3), pursuant to which the authority is required to list the staff and give details of their contractual rights.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lastly, it would make sense to insert in Article 4 a further mandatory criterion, namely past compliance by the operator with its social obligations deriving from legislation or collective agreements, and an option for competent authorities to take account of whether the level of wages and quality of working conditions the operator intends to offer its workers are sufficiently high.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>3.</u>   <u>Provision of information to users, competing operators and the competent authorities</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The proposal's provisions relating to the provision of information to persons who play a part in the public transport sector could also be improved (amendments to Articles 4(3), 6(d), 9(1), 9(5) and 13(3)(c)).</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>4.</u>   <u>Continuity and quality of the public service</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Firstly, an amendment is proposed to ensure that public service contracts provide for penalties in the event of failure to fulfil the obligations they lay down and the obligations on operators to maintain publicly owned assets (Article 6).</p>
<p class="text-left">Secondly, it is proposed that marketing, comfort, capacity and accessibility to all be added to the mandatory criteria set out in Article 4(2).</p>
<p class="text-left">In Article 6(c), a mechanism authorising the competent authority to include a clause in the contract allowing it to unilaterally extend the contract by no more than six months where it has been prevented by factors outside its control from completing a procedure that has already been opened in accordance with the regulation, even if such an extension means that the contract's maximum authorised duration is exceeded.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lastly, it is proposed that competent authorities be allowed to include amongst the minimum criteria set out in Article 10 a requirement for operators to give up to six months notice of their intention to discontinue the provision of a service they operate.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>5.</u>   <u>Maximum duration of contracts</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">The maximum duration of contracts should be a raised from five to eight years, in particular owing to the need to encourage operators to make the necessary investments in developing a transport strategy and to ensure quality of service; this increase also makes it possible to ensure greater stability of employment for workers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nevertheless, there are grounds for stipulating that contracts may be of a longer duration where operators assume a substantial proportion of the revenue risk.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>6.</u>   <u>Transitional period</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">In view of the actual situation in the sector, it would be realistic to increase the transitional period from three to five years, or even seven years, where a contract was the subject of a tendering or quality comparison procedure before the Regulation entered into force.</p>
<p class="text-left"><strong><u>7.</u>   <u>Miscellaneous</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-left">Certain aspects of the quality comparison procedure (Article 8) also need to be clarified, in particular by stressing the requirement to compare environmental performance, as do certain aspects of the tendering procedure (Article 12). Article 9(1) on subcontracting is amended so make it clear that it is intended to protect SMEs and reduce the risks of nepotism.</p>
<p class="text-left">The principle of derogations (Article 7) is very important, as it means that account can be taken of specific situations where the tendering procedure is manifestly inadequate.
